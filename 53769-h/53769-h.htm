<p>The Author wishes to acknowledge the great
debt of gratitude which he owes to those who
have assisted him by the loan of books, photographs,
and prints.</p>

<p>First and foremost stands the Right Honourable
Lewis Harcourt, M.P., who has most kindly
afforded him access to his unique collection of
Eton books&mdash;eventually destined, it is understood,
for the school library.</p>

<p>The Earl of Rosebery, K.G., has also shown
great good-nature in lending a number of interesting
prints, reproductions of which will be found
amongst the illustrations.</p>

<p>Especial thanks are due to Mr. Robert John
Graham Simmonds, resident agent of the Hawkesyard
estate, who took considerable trouble to
furnish valuable information concerning the old
Eton organ case, a photograph of which, by the
courteous permission of the Dominican fathers,
was taken in their chapel at Rugeley. The
photographs of the old oak panelling formerly in
the Eton Chapel were obligingly contributed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Mrs. Sheridan, in whose entrance hall at Frampton
Court, Dorset, this panelling now is.</p>

<p>The author also wishes to thank a number of
old Etonians who have furnished him with
anecdotes and notes which have proved of much
assistance. Chief among these must be mentioned
his cousin, the Right Hon. Sir Algernon
West, one of the few survivors of “Montem,”
Mr. Douglas Ainslie, and Mr. Vivian Bulkeley
Johnson&mdash;some other obligations are acknowledged
in the text. His debt to previous books
dealing with Eton will be evident; and a number
of the coloured plates are reproduced from the
scarce work on Public Schools published by
Ackermann a little short of a hundred years ago.</p>

<h2>I<br />
EARLY DAYS</h2>


<p>Amongst public schools Eton admittedly occupies
a unique position. Every one admires the
beauty of its surroundings, whilst to those
possessed of imagination&mdash;more especially, of
course, if they are Etonians&mdash;the school and its
traditions cannot fail to appeal.</p>

<p>In addition to many of its associations being
connected with glorious chapters of English
history, the old quadrangle, chapel, and playing
fields possess a peculiar charm of their own, due
to a feeling that the spirit of past ages still hovers
around them. There is, indeed, a real sentimental
pleasure in the thought that many of England’s
greatest men laid the foundations of brilliant
and successful careers amidst these venerable and
picturesque surroundings. No other school can
claim to have sent forth such a cohort of distinguished
figures to make their mark in the world;
and of this fine pageant of boyhood not a few,
without doubt, owed their success to the spirit
of manly independence and splendid unconscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
happiness which the genius of the place seems to
have the gift of bestowing.</p>

<p>No other school exercises such an attraction
over its old boys as Eton, with many of whom the
traditions of the place become almost a second
religion. “I hate Eton,” the writer once heard
an individual who had been educated elsewhere
frankly say, “for whenever I come across two or
three old Etonians, and the subject is mentioned,
they can talk of nothing else.”</p>

<p>The affection felt for the school is the greatest
justification for its existence; an educational institution
which can inspire those sent there with
a profound and lasting pride and belief in its
superiority over all other schools, must of necessity
possess some special and fine qualities not to be
found elsewhere. The vast majority of boys
experience a vague feeling of sentimental regret
when the time for leaving arrives&mdash;they have a
keen sense of the break with a number of old and
pleasant associations, soon to become things of
the past&mdash;the school yard and the venerable old
buildings, so lovingly touched by the hand of
Time, never seem so attractive as then, whilst
the incomparable playing fields, in their summer
loveliness, acquire a peculiar and unique charm.
As a gifted son of Eton, the late Mr. Mowbray
Morris, has so well said, “shaded by their immemorial
brotherhood of elms, and kissed by the
silver winding river, they will stand undimmed
and unforgotten when the memory of many a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
more famous, many a more splendid scene has
passed away.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOUNDATION</div>

<p>For the true Etonian there is no such thing
as a final parting from these surroundings, the
indefinable charm of which remains in his mind
up to the last day of his life. Fitly enough, this
love for Eton, handed on from generation to
generation, and affecting every kind of disposition
and character, has been most happily expressed
by a poet who was himself an Etonian&mdash;John
Moultrie. May his lines continue to be applicable
to the old school for many ages to come!</p>

<div class="indentone">And through thy spacious courts, and o’er thy green

<p>The history of the College has been so ably
written by Sir Henry Maxwell Lyte, that it
would here be superfluous to do more than touch
upon a few incidents of special interest.</p>

<p>Henry VI., unlike the warlike Plantagenets
from whom he sprang, was essentially of studious
disposition, and the foundation of a college&mdash;one of
his favourite schemes, almost from boyhood&mdash;was a
project which he at once gratified on reaching years
of discretion. In 1441, when nineteen, he granted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the original charter to “The King’s College of our
Lady of Eton besides Wyndsor.”</p>

<p>This ancient constitution remained in force till
the year 1869, when a new governing body was
introduced, which drew up new statutes two years
later. The last Fellow representing the old foundation,
as instituted by Henry VI., was the late
Bursar, the Rev. W. A. Carter, who died in 1892.</p>

<p>On the completion of the arrangements for the
institution of the College, the old parish church,
standing in what is now the graveyard of the
chapel, was pulled down, and a new edifice of “the
hard stone of Kent&mdash;the most substantial and the
best abiding,” begun. Roger Keyes, before Warden
of All Souls College, Oxford, was appointed master
of the works, receiving a patent of nobility and a
grant of arms for his services. At the same time
the newly founded College was assigned a coat
of arms, three white lilies (typical of the Virgin
and of the bright flowers of science) upon a field
of sable being combined with the fleur-de-lys of
France and the leopard passant of England, to
form the design with which Etonians have been
familiar for more than four hundred and fifty
years.</p>

<p>In 1442 came the first Provost, William of
Waynflete, from Winchester, bringing with him,
no doubt, some scholars who formed the nucleus of
the new foundation. So much on the lines of the
College on the banks of the Itchen was Eton
founded, though from the first various differences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
prevailed&mdash;the number of commoners in college
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">commensales in collegio</i>), for instance, was doubled,
it being stipulated that they must belong to
families entitled to bear arms.</p>

<p>The connection between the two schools was
close. An alliance, known as the “Amicabilis Concordia,”
pledging Eton and Winchester to a mutual
defence of each other’s rights and privileges, was
instituted&mdash;a bond of friendship and amity which
has never been broken up to the present day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ORIGINAL DESIGN</div>

<p>The original design of Henry VI. had contemplated
a huge nave for the chapel, which would
have stretched right down what is now known as
Keate’s Lane. This, however, was never completed,
William of Waynflete eventually finishing
the building with the present ante-chapel, built of
Headington stone, for which, it should be added,
Bath stone was substituted some thirty-four
years ago.</p>

<p>There exists a legend that in the reign of
Edward IV. Eton only escaped suppression owing
to the intercession of Jane Shore. Though the
story seems to rest upon no solid historical
foundation, it is curious to note that two portraits
of this Royal favourite are preserved in the
Provost’s Lodge.</p>

<p>When Henry VII. escorted Philip of Castile
“toward the seaside” on his return home in 1505,
the two kings passed through Windsor&mdash;“all the
children of Eaton standing along the barres of the
Church yeard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry VIII. paid a visit to the school in July
1510, and made a monetary donation, as was
customary in his day.</p>

<p>The College curriculum at that time seems to
have been of a somewhat elementary kind: as late
as 1530 no Greek was taught. Great stress was
laid upon prayers and devotion, as the following
description left to us by William Malim, Headmaster
in 1561, shows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“They come to schole at vj. of the clok in the mornyng.
They say Deus misereatur, with a colecte; at ix, they say
De profundis and go to brekefaste. Within a quarter of an
howere cum ageyne, and tary (till) xj. and then to dyner; at
v. to soper, afore an antheme and De profundis.</p>

<p>Two prepositores in every forme, whiche dothe give in
a schrowe the absentes namys at any lecture, and shewith
when and at what tyme both in the fore none for the tyme
past and at v.</p>

<p>Also ij. prepositores in the body of the chirche, ij. in
the gwere for spekyng of Laten in the third forme and all
other, every one a custos, and in every howse a monytor.</p>

<p>When they goe home, ij. and ij. in order, a monitor to
se that they do soe tyll they come at there hostise dore.
Also prevy monytores how many the master wylle. Prepositores
in the field whan they play, for fyghtyng, rent clothes,
blew eyes, or siche like.</p>

<p>Prepositores for yll kept hedys, unwasshid facys, fowle
clothes, and sich other. Yff there be iiij. or v. in a howse,
monytores for chydyng and for Laten spekyng.</p>

<p>When any dothe come newe, the master dothe inquire
fro whens he comyth, what frendys he hathe, whether there
be any plage. No man gothe owte off the schole nother
home to his frendes without the masteres lycence. Yff
there be any dullard, the master gyvith his frends warnyng,
and puttyth hym away, that he sclander not the schole.“</p></blockquote>

<p>Latin plays were acted during the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
winter evenings. Several of these were written
by Nicholas Udall (Headmaster, 1534-1541), the
author of <cite>Ralph Roister Doister</cite>, the first English
comedy.</p>

<p>For almost two hundred years, from 1563,
when William Malim resigned (owing, it is said,
to his severity having caused some boys to run
away), comparatively obscure men held the office
of Headmaster, and were overshadowed by
Provosts who left their mark upon the school.</p>

<p>Henry VIII. was one day much astonished
when informed by Sir Thomas Wyatt that he had
discovered a living of a hundred a year which
would be more than enough for him. “We have
no such thing in England,” said the King. “Yes,
Sir,” replied Sir Thomas, “the Provostship of
Eton, where a man has his diet, his lodging, his
horse-meat, his servants’ wages, his riding charges,
and £100 per annum.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ETONIAN MARTYRS</div>

<p>During the troublous days of the Reformation
Eton appears to have undergone little change; but
a number of old Etonians and Fellows went to the
stake for Protestantism under Queen Mary.</p>

<p>The names of the Etonians who underwent
martyrdom for the reformed faith were <span class="smcap">John
Fuller</span>, who became a scholar of King’s in 1527,
and was burnt to death on Jesus Green in Cambridge,
April 2, 1556; <span class="smcap">Robert Glover</span>, scholar
of King’s in 1533, burnt to death at Coventry
on September 20, 1555; <span class="smcap">Lawrence Saunders</span>,
scholar of King’s in 1538, burnt to death at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Coventry on February 8, 1556; <span class="smcap">John Hullier</span>,
scholar of King’s also, in 1588, burnt to
death on Jesus Green, Cambridge, on April 2,
1556. “Their faith was strong unto death and
they sealed their belief with their blood.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, Dr. Henry Cole, appointed
Provost in 1554, behaved in a disgraceful manner.
Having advocated the Reformation, he became in
Queen Mary’s reign a rigid Romanist, and was
appointed by her to preach, before the execution
of Cranmer, in St. Mary’s Church at Oxford. He
became Dean of St. Paul’s in 1556, and Vicar-General
under Cardinal Pole in 1557. Soon after
the accession of Elizabeth he was deprived of
his Deanery, fined 500 marks, and imprisoned.
Whether he was formally deprived of the Provostship,
or withdrew silently, does not appear. He
died in the Fleet in 1561.</p>

<p>In 1563 and 1570 Queen Elizabeth paid visits
to the College, and a memorial of her beneficence
is still to be seen on a panel of the College
hall.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>At that time the school seems to have been
divided into seven forms; of these the first three
were under the Lower Master&mdash;an arrangement
which was only altered in 1868, when First and
Second Forms ceased to exist and a Fourth Form
was included as part of what now corresponds to
Lower School. It is a curious coincidence that
even in those early days Fourth Form during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
part of the school hours were under the Lower
Master’s control.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“FLOGGING DAY”</div>

<p>Their two meals were dinner at eleven and
supper at seven, bedtime being at eight. Friday,
it is interesting to learn, was set aside as “flogging
day.”</p>

<p>At a comparatively early period in the history
of the school the tendency which within the last
forty years abolished the First and Second Forms
seems to have been in existence, no First Form
figuring in the school list of 1678, in which its
place is taken by the Bibler’s seat&mdash;the Bibler
being a boy deputed to read a portion of Scripture
in the Hall during dinner.</p>

<p>In Queen Elizabeth’s day the praepostors or
“prepositores,” as they were then called, played
a great part in the daily round of school life.
There were then two of them in every form who
noted down absentees and performed other duties
such as the praepostors of the writer’s own day
(1879-83) were wont to perform.</p>

<p>Up to quite recent years, it may be added,
there was a praepostor to every division of the
school, the office being taken by each boy in turn,
who marked the boys in at school and chapel,
collected work from boys staying out, and the
like. Now, however, the only division which
retains a praepostor is the Headmaster’s.</p>

<p>Eton was also connected with the Virgin Queen
by its Provost, Sir Henry Savile, who had instructed
her in Greek. Sir Henry is said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
have been stern in his theory and practice of discipline
respecting the scholars. He preferred boys
of steady habits and resolute industry to the more
showy but more flighty students. He looked on
the sprightly wits, as they were termed, with dislike
and distrust. According to his judgment,
irregularity in study was sure to be accompanied
by irregularity in other things. He used to say,
“Give me the plodding student. If I would look
for wits, I would go to Newgate: there be the
wits.”</p>

<p>It would seem that at this time the custom of
inscribing the names of noblemen at the head of
their division&mdash;whether they deserved it or not&mdash;still
flourished. Youthful scions of aristocracy enjoyed
many privileges&mdash;young Lord Wriothesley, for
instance, who was at Eton in 1615, had a page to
wait upon him at meals.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Savile died at Eton on February
19, 1621, and was buried in the College Chapel.
He was married, but left no family. An amusing
anecdote is told of Lady Savile, who, like the
wives of other hard-reading men, was jealous of
her husband’s books. The date of the anecdote
is the time when Savile was preparing his great
edition of Chrysostom. “This work,” we are
told, “required such long and close application
that Sir Henry’s lady thought herself neglected,
and coming to him one day into his study, she
said, ‘Sir Henry, I would I were a book too,
and then you would a little more respect me.’ To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
which one standing by replied, ‘You must then
be an almanack, madam, that he might change
you every year,’ which answer, it is added, displeased
her, as it is easy to believe.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR HENRY WOTTON</div>

<p>The next man of note who became Provost
was Sir Henry Wotton, who obtained the appointment
in place of Lord Bacon, it being feared
that the debts of the latter might bring discredit
upon the College. Wotton it was who built the
still existing Lower School with its quaint pillars.</p>

<p>Izaak Walton speaks of this in the <cite>Compleat
Angler</cite>:&mdash;“He (Wotton) was a constant
of all those youths in that school, in whom he
found either a constant diligence or a genius that
prompted them to learning; for whose encouragement
he was (besides many other things of
necessity and beauty) at the charge of setting up
in it two rows of pillars, on which he caused
to be choicely drawn the pictures of divers of
the most famous Greek and Latin historians,
poets and orators; persuading them not to neglect
rhetoric, because ‘Almighty God hath left mankind
affections to be wrought upon.’”</p>

<p>Izaak Walton and Sir Henry loved to fish
together, and the spot where the two friends indulged
their love of angling is well known. It
was about a quarter of a mile below the College
at a picturesque bend of the river which, once
an ancient fishery, is still known as Black Potts.</p>

<p>Here the late Dr. Hornby had a riverside villa
where he spent a good deal of his time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Henry was a great observer of boyhood, as
certain quaint observations of his show:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“When I mark in children much solitude and silence I
like it not, nor anything born before its time, as this must
needs be in that sociable and exposed life as they are for the
most part. When either alone or in company they sit still
without doing of anything, I like it worse. For surely all
disposition to idleness and vacancie, even before they grow
habits, are dangerous; and there is commonly but little
distance in time between doing of nothing and doing of ill.”</p></blockquote>

<p>He was besides a philosopher sagely writing:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The seeing that very place where I sate when a boy,
occasioned me to remember those very thoughts of my
youth, which then possessed me; sweet thoughts indeed,
that promised my growing years numerous pleasures without
mixture of cares, and those to be enjoyed when time (which
I therefore thought slow-paced) had changed my youth into
manhood. But age and experience have taught me that
those were but empty hopes. And though my days have
been many, and those mixed with more pleasures than the
sons of men do usually enjoy, yet I have always found it
true, as my Saviour did foretell, ‘<em>Sufficient for the day is the
evil thereof</em>.’ Nevertheless I saw there a succession of boys
using the same recreations, and questionless possessed with
the same thoughts. Thus one generation succeeds another,
both in their lives, recreations, hopes, fears, and deaths.”</p></blockquote>

<p>During the Provostship of Wotton the tranquillity
of Eton life was disturbed by troops being
quartered in the town, whilst a number of French
hostages had such a bad effect upon the boys, with
whom they mingled, and upon the Fellows, whom
they introduced to improper characters, that De
Foix, the French Ambassador, was entreated to
interfere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">PROVOST ROUSE</div>

<p>Sir Henry Wotton’s successor as Provost,
Stewart by name, took up arms for King Charles
I. at Oxford, his example being followed by a
number of loyal Etonians. With the triumph
of the Commonwealth came a Roundhead Provost,
Francis Rouse by name, who was afterwards
Speaker of the Barebones Parliament and one
of Cromwell’s peers. Eton did not fare badly
under the Protector, but the spirit of loyalty to
the king nevertheless seems to have continued
dominant, and the “Restoration” was welcomed
with joy.</p>

<p>Francis Lord Rouse had been buried with great
pomp in Lupton’s Chapel, banners and escutcheons
being set up to commemorate his memory, which
is still kept green by the old elms he planted in
the playing fields. All such insignia, however,
were destroyed when the king had come into his
own, and were torn down and thrown away as
tokens of “damned baseness and rebellion” by the
Royalist Provost and Fellows. In 1767 the irons
which had kept these picturesque memorials in
place were still to be seen, but all traces of them
are now gone; probably they were torn out at
the “restoration” of 1846. To us of a later and
more impartial age, the insults heaped upon the
memory of Provost Rouse seem to have been
undeserved, and there certainly appears no justification
for his having been called an “illiterate old
Jew.” On the other hand, the imagination cannot
be otherwise than stirred by the name of Provost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Allestree, who had fought for King Charles in the
students’ troop at Oxford and at the risk of his
life conducted a correspondence for Charles II.
His services to the Royalist cause would, nevertheless,
in all probability not have been repaid had
not Rochester introduced him to the frivolous
king. Rochester had made a bet that he would
find an uglier man than Lauderdale, and having
come across Allestree, who was exceedingly unattractive
in face, introduced him to Charles in
order to win the wager. Charles then recalled
the devotion of the individual with whom he was
confronted, and with justice and good judgment
made him Provost of Eton.</p>

<p>Allestree, though he resided a good deal at
Oxford, did his best to set Eton in order, and,
amongst other wise and useful acts, built Upper
School. Owing, however, to defective construction,
or to a fire, this had to be entirely rebuilt by
subscription a few years later, when it assumed the
form which it still retains.</p>

<p>Provost Allestree found the College in debt
and difficulty, and the reputation of the school
greatly decayed. He left an unencumbered and
flourishing revenue, and restored the fame of Eton
as a place of learning to its natural eminence.
Besides building Upper School at his own private
expense, he also erected the apartments and cloister
under it, occupying the whole western side of the
great quadrangle. It was at the instance of this
Provost, it should be added, that the King passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
a grant under the broad seal that, for the future,
five of the seven Fellows should be such as had
been educated at Eton School and were Fellows of
King’s College.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A VISIT FROM PEPYS</div>

<p>In February 1666, in a coach with four horses&mdash;“mighty
fine”&mdash;Pepys and his wife paid a visit
to Windsor. After seeing the Castle, described
by the famous diarist as “the most romantique
castle that is in the world,” they went on to
Eton. Here Mrs. Pepys&mdash;rather ungallantly,
perhaps&mdash;was left in the coach, whilst her husband,
accompanied by Headmaster Montague, explored
the College and drank the College beer, both of
which he set down in his diary as being “very
good.”</p>

<p>By this time the Oppidans had increased to
such an extent that they greatly outnumbered the
Collegers. In 1614 there seem to have been
only forty “Commensalls,” as the Oppidans were
then called, although the more familiar term had
also long been in use; but after the Civil War
they ceased to board and lodge with the Collegers
(the whole school dined in the College Hall as
late as the beginning of the seventeenth century),
and gradually grew in number to such an extent
that in the school list of 1678, out of 207 boys,
no fewer than 129 were Oppidans.</p>

<p>Zachary Cradock, Provost in 1680, it is said,
owed his appointment to a sermon on Providence,
preached before Charles II., to whom he was
chaplain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The first Headmaster of Eton of whom any
satisfactory account has survived, was John Newborough,
described as “versed in men as well as in
books, and admired and respected by old and
young.” Newborough numbered many who afterwards
became celebrated amongst his pupils: Sir
Robert Walpole and his brother Lord Walpole of
Wolterton&mdash;ancestors of the present writer&mdash;Horace
St. John, Townshend, and many other
well-known public men, profited by his tuition.
Of Sir Robert, Newborough was specially fond,
being rightly convinced that he would rise to
eminence.</p>

<p>Sir Robert loved Eton, and probably one of the
proudest moments of his career was a certain
Thursday in Election Week, 1735, when, with a
number of other old Etonians, he went with the
Duke of Cumberland to hear the speeches in the
College Hall, and heard a number of verses recited,
the great majority of which were in praise of himself.
With Dr. Bland, his old friend, who was
then Provost, he appears to have dominated the
whole ceremony. So much so was this the case
that a dissatisfied Fellow wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>’Tis to be wished that these performances may be lost
and forgott that posterity may not see how abandoned this
place was to flattery when Dr. B&mdash;&mdash; was Provost, and
when Sir Robert was First Minister.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Eton authorities, no doubt, were very
proud of Sir Robert, the first Etonian Prime
Minister, and the first of a long series of eminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Etonians who were to shed lustre upon the
school.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“SMOAKING”</div>

<p>School life in the seventeenth century was a
totally different thing from what it is to-day; all
sorts of queer usages and ideas prevailed. In 1662,
for instance, smoking was actually made compulsory
for Eton boys. This was during the plague, when,
according to one Tom Rogers, all the boys were
obliged to “smoak” in the school every morning,
and he himself was never whipped so much in his
life as he was one morning for not “smoaking.”</p>

<p>As showing the school life of the period the
following bill for “extras” is interesting. It was
for a boy named Patrick, from April 1687 to March
1688, and bears Newborough’s receipt as Headmaster.</p>

<p>The “bat and ram club” was used in connection
with an extremely barbarous custom of hunting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and killing a ram at election-tide, the poor animal
being provided by the College butcher. So popular
was this brutal sport, that boys summoned home
before the last day of the half wrote beseeching
their parents to allow them to remain and see “ye
ram” die according to custom.</p>

<p>This ram-baiting appears to have taken its
origin from a usage connected with the Manor
of Wrotham in Norfolk, given to the College by
the founder. At Wrotham Manor during the
harvest-home a ram was let loose and given to
the tenants if they could catch him.</p>

<p>For many years later the brutal sport continued
to flourish, a ram hunt in the playing fields being
attended by the Duke of Cumberland on Election
Saturday 1730, when he was nine years old. He
struck the first blow, and is said to have returned
to Windsor “very well pleased.”</p>

<p>Our ancestors held curious views as to the
education of the young, and seem to have seen
no harm in children being familiarised with the
grossest forms of cruelty. Nevertheless the ram-hunting,
after being modified, disappeared before
the close of the eighteenth century. For some years,
however, its recollection was maintained by a ram
pasty served at election time in the College hall.
We may regard the indigestion which must almost
certainly have followed upon indulgence in such a
dish as a mild form of retribution for the tortures
which some of those present had formerly inflicted
upon the poor rams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early seventeenth century Shrove Tuesday
was also marked by a barbarous usage. On that
day no work was done after 8 a.m., and, as in other
parts of England, some live bird was tormented.
The usual practice was for the College cook to get
hold of a young crow and fasten it with a pancake
to a door, when the boys would then worry it to
death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FIRST DAME</div>

<p>Newborough, owing to failing health, resigned
his headmastership in 1711 and died the following
year. He was succeeded by Dr. Snape, a self-made
man, whose mother and afterwards his sister
kept the earliest recorded “Dames’” houses at
Eton. On his resignation in 1720 the school had
reached a total of 400 boys, though some alleged
that one of these was a town boy whose name
Snape had added to form a round sum.</p>

<p>Under his successor, Dr. Henry Bland, the
numbers further increased to 425, one of whom was
a boy, always playing upon a cracked flute, who
was to be known to posterity as Dr. Arne.</p>

<p>After the South Sea Bubble had wrought widespread
ruin the school shrank again to 325. Bland
only remained at Eton eight years. Sir Robert
Walpole, who never forgot an Etonian schoolfellow,
presented him with the Deanery of Durham,
besides offering him a bishopric, which was declined.</p>

<p>Dr. William George then became Headmaster.
He was a very good classical scholar, and some
iambics of his so charmed Pope Benedict XIV.
that he declared that had the writer been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Catholic he would have made him a cardinal; as it
was he had a cardinal’s cap placed upon the manuscript.
Dr. George’s reign at Eton came to an
end in 1743, when he was elected Provost of King’s.</p>

<p>At this period a very curious state of affairs prevailed
at Eton in regard to the appointment of
the teaching staff. The Headmaster was free to
choose his own assistants, whom he paid himself;
but he received numerous fees and presents from
each boy under him. On the other hand, the Lower
Master&mdash;who maintained a sort of preparatory
school, to which came boys of very tender age&mdash;was
able to sell his assistant masterships, like
waiterships at a restaurant, as he left the fees and
presents to his assistants.</p>

<p>This is shown by a quaint advertisement which
appeared in the <cite>London Evening Post</cite> of November
9, 1731:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Whereas Mr. Franc. Goode, under-master of Eaton, does
hereby signify that there will be at Christmas next, or soon
after, two vacancies in his school&mdash;viz., as assistants to him
and tutors to the young gents: if any two gentlemen of
either University (who have commenced the degree of B.A.
at least) shall think themselves duly qualified, and are
desirous of such an employment, let them enquire of John
Potts, Pickleman in Gracious Street, or at Mr. G.’s own
house in Eaton College, where they may purchase the same
at a reasonable rate, and on conditions fully to their own
satisfaction.&mdash;<span class="smcap">F. Goode.</span> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">N.B.</i>&mdash;It was erroneously reported
that the last place was disposed of under 40s.</p></blockquote>

<p>An assistant master, Dr. Cooke, succeeded Dr.
George as Headmaster, but managed the school so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
badly that his tenure of office only lasted two years,
during which time the number of boys decreased, and
Eton fell into some disrepute. Cooke was a very
unpopular man, dowered with a “gossip’s ear and a
tatler’s pen,” and he seems to have possessed most
of the worst faults of a schoolmaster and to
have made many mistakes; this, however, did not
prevent him being given a fellowship when Dr.
Sumner, an able and active teacher, was put in his
place. The efforts of the latter, however, were
able to restore only a modified degree of prosperity
to the school, which had fallen out of general
favour owing to the misrule of his predecessor. A
paragraph in the <cite>Daily Advertiser</cite> of August 11,
1747, shows this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>King George II. visited the College and School of Eton,
when on short notice Master Slater of Bedford, Master
Masham of Reading and Master Williams of London spoke
each a Latin speech (most probably made by their masters)
with which His Majesty seemed exceedingly well pleased,
and obtained for them a week’s holidays. To the young
orators five guineas each had been more acceptable.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">DR. BARNARD</div>

<p>In 1754, however, the ancient fame of Eton
began to revive owing to the appointment of Dr.
Barnard&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnum et memorabile nomen</i>! He was
made Headmaster through the Townshend and
Walpole interests, which were active on his behalf.
Under his vigorous rule the school flourished; 522
boys, the highest number known up to that time,
being on the list on his promotion to the Provostship
in 1756. Barnard had no patience with fopperies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
in boys, and had occasional “difficulties” with
the Eton “swells” of his day on the point of dress.</p>

<p>Charles James Fox gave him a good deal of
trouble. His absence at Spa for a year sent him
back to Eton a regular fop, and a very sound flogging
appears to have done him but very little good.</p>

<p>Dr. Barnard also seems rather to have despised
any tendency towards fine ways in his pupils.
His old pupil, Christopher Anstey, alludes to this
in his <cite>Bath Guide</cite>, in a portion of which a
critical mother, “Mrs. Danglecub,” who has a son
at school,</p>

</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">A REVOLT</div>

<p>The “just such another” was Dr. Foster, who
proved to be the very opposite of Barnard, and
became highly unpopular, in great part owing to
the considerable social disadvantage of his being the
son of a Windsor tradesman. He was tactless and
unfitted for his position, and the school did anything
but prosper under his rule; indeed, the numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
dropped to 250. Meanwhile, the boys got quite
out of hand, and several rebellions occurred,
amongst them the famous secession of more than
half the school&mdash;160 boys&mdash;to Maidenhead.</p>

<p>One of the ringleaders of the outbreak was
Lord Harrington, a boy of much natural spirit.
He was foremost amongst those who threw their
books into the Thames and marched away. Like
the rest of the rebels he took an oath, or rather
swore, he would be d&mdash;&mdash;d if ever he returned
to school again. When, therefore, he came to
London to the old Lord Harrington’s and sent up
his name, his father would only speak to him at
the door, insisting on his immediate return to
Eton. “Sir,” said the son, “consider I shall be
d&mdash;&mdash;d if I do!” “And I,” answered the father,
“will be d&mdash;&mdash;d if you don’t!” “Yes, my Lord,”
replied the son, “but you will be d&mdash;&mdash;d whether I
do or no!”</p>

<p>The revolt seems to have completely broken
the Headmaster’s spirit; the school fell in numbers
to 230, and in 1775 he made way for Dr. Davies,
who ruled Eton for twenty years. Unlike his
predecessor, Davies was not unpopular with the
boys, but unfortunately he could not manage his
assistants, with whom he quarrelled, and then
attempted to manage the school alone. At that
time Eton was largely composed of turbulent
spirits, quick to see what glorious opportunities
for riot lay at hand, and before long the unfortunate
Davies was driven out of Upper School,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
pelted with books, and reduced to such a condition
of despair that he was obliged to make terms
with the other masters, who eventually did succeed
in establishing something like order. His subsequent
period of rule was more peaceful.</p>

<p>During the middle portion of the eighteenth
century a number of still existing Eton institutions
flourished, though generally accompanied by quaint
usages now obsolete. Referring, for instance, to
“Tryals,” in 1766, Thomas James, describing the
school curriculum, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If Boys gain their Removes with honour, we have a good
custom of rewarding each with a <em>Shilling</em> (if higher in the
school, 2/6d.), which is given them by the Dames and placed
to the Father’s account.</p></blockquote>

<p>This custom, though in 1879 it had fallen into
complete abeyance, was still more or less extant
twenty years earlier; for Mr. Brinsley Richards, in
his most interesting recollections of his Eton days,
mentions that, having gained promotion in Third
Form by handing in three consecutive copies of
nonsense verses, in which there was no mistake, the
Captain of Lower School claimed an old privilege,
and asked that the Lower School might have a
“play at four,” the question also arising whether
the writer of the verses was not entitled to receive
2s. 6d., which he eventually got. As a matter of
fact, had the precedents been strictly followed, one
shilling would have been the reward.</p>

<p>In the late eighteenth century, the holidays
consisted of a month at Christmas, a fortnight at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Easter, and the month of August. Then, as now,
the Eton boys enjoyed more half-holidays than
were granted at other schools. In 1776, however,
the usual curriculum was interrupted by a day of
“fasting and penitence” on account of British
disasters in America, the colony beyond the seas,
which, grown into a great country, has since sent
many of her sons to be educated at the old school.</p>

<p>The last Headmaster of the eighteenth century
was Dr. Heath. During the early part of his
reign he raised the school to 489, but in the last
year the numbers had sunk to 357. It was a very
lax time, and the boys were allowed to do, and
did do, many things which could hardly have been
to the taste of a fond parent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SCHOOL MAGAZINES</div>

<p>In 1786 seems to have been started the first
school magazine&mdash;the <cite>Microcosm</cite>, the successors of
which have been the <cite>Miniature</cite> (1804), the <cite>Linger</cite>
(edited by G. B. Maturin and W. G. Cookesley,
for collegers only, 1818), the <cite>College Magazine</cite>
(John Moultrie, 1818), the <cite>Etonian</cite> (Praed, 1820),
the <cite>Salt Bearer</cite> (1820), the <cite>Eton Miscellany</cite> (1827),
the <cite>Oppidan</cite> (1828), the <cite>Eton College Magazine</cite>
(1832), the <cite>Kaleidoscope</cite> (1833), the <cite>Eton Bureau</cite>
(1842), the <cite>Eton School Magazine</cite> (1848), the
<cite>Porticus Etonensis</cite> (1859), the <cite>Eton Observer</cite>
(1860), the <cite>Phœnix</cite> (1861), and the still flourishing
<cite>Eton College Chronicle</cite> (1863).</p>

<p>At various periods since the last date ephemeral
publications have intermittently appeared. These,
however, are scarcely of sufficient importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to require mention, the majority having enjoyed
but a very brief existence. The most recent of
these journalistic efforts was the <cite>Eton Illustrated
Magazine</cite>, two numbers of which made their
appearance at the beginning of the present year
(1911). Though a third was announced, the
magazine came to a premature end, owing, it
was said, to the censorship exercised by the
authorities. According to an unwritten law,
no reference must be made to the Eton Officers’
Training Corps, and owing to this and the suppression
of skits and humorous paragraphs, it was
decided to suspend publication.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the eighteenth century
one of the most prominent Etonians was
William Windham, in after-life a powerful politician,
and “the darling of Norfolk.” At school
he achieved distinction as a fine scholar, besides
being “the best cricketer, the best leaper, swimmer,
rower, and skater, the best fencer, the best boxer,
the best runner, and the best horseman of his
time.”</p>

<p>The owner of a splendid estate&mdash;Felbrigg Hall&mdash;Windham
was the beau-ideal of an English
gentleman, whose merits were recognised alike by
friend and foe.</p>

<p>Heath was succeeded in the headmastership by
Dr. Goodall, under whose mild and easy-going rule
discipline continued to be lax. Owing, however, to
the warm affection and patronage of George III.,
the school continued to prosper, its numbers rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
under Goodall to 511. Of fine appearance and
courteous bearing, he is said to have looked every
inch an Eton Headmaster. Devoted to the school
where, as a scholar and assistant master, he had
passed most of his life, he was an ultra-Conservative
in everything which appertained to it; under
his rule no changes took place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. GOODALL</div>

<p>Probably this Headmaster never appeared to
better advantage when, after the glorious battle
of Trafalgar, he publicly called up Horace Nelson,
nephew of the immortal admiral, and in a kind
and delicate manner informed him of his heroic
uncle’s death. Though the tears were visible in
the boy’s eyes, Dr. Goodall’s well-chosen words
soothed his grief, and there lurked on his countenance
a smile of delight at the greatest victory ever
gained by this country in any naval engagement
over a gallant foe.</p>

<p>“There was a pleasant joyousness in Dr. Goodall,”
said one of his pupils, “which beamed and
overflowed in his face; and it seemed an odd
caprice of fortune by which such a jovial spirit
was invested with the solemn dignity of a schoolmaster.”
The blandness and good-nature which
made him universally popular both as Headmaster
and as Provost, were an element of weakness when
he had to cope with the turbulent spirits; and Eton
discipline did not improve under his rule. His
rich fund of anecdote, sprightly wit, and genial
spirit made his society very much sought in days
when those pleasant qualifications were highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
valued, and he was a great personal favourite
with the king. It was not so much the fault of
the individual as of the age, if he had a profound
respect for the peerage, and could see few defects
of scholarship in his more aristocratic pupils.
<a id="Ref_28"></a>Those were the days, it must be remembered,
when the young peers, sons of peers, and baronets
sat in the stalls in the College chapel, visibly elevated
above their fellows. Then, too, it was not
an uncommon thing for an Eton boy, whose friends
were connected with the Court, to hold a commission
in the Guards and draw the regular pay.
Sometimes, if he obtained an appointment as one
of the royal pages, he was gazetted while yet a
mere child. “I had the honour this morning,”
Goodall is reported to have said on one occasion,
“of flogging a major in His Majesty’s service.”</p>

<p>With the death of this courteous pedagogue
in 1840 old Eton may be said to have passed away;
whilst he lived many alterations and reforms
were delayed, no change whatever being made
during his term of office as Provost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A LAST FAREWELL</div>

<p>Though he has been blamed for not having made
some improvement in the lot of the collegers,
he appears to have enjoyed great popularity at
Eton, and to have been hospitable and benevolent.
Glancing through a copy of <cite>Alumni Etonenses</cite>,
enriched with a number of manuscript notes, appended
by the late Reverend George John Dupuis,
Vice-Provost, the writer came upon an enthusiastic
tribute to the memory of Dr. Goodall, who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
described as eminent for his talents, his benevolence,
and charity. A somewhat touching eulogy, after
a description of the old Provost’s funeral in the
College chapel, concludes, “Farewell, kind and
good old man.”</p>

<h2>II<br />
OLD CUSTOMS AND WAYS</h2>


<p>During George the Third’s reign Eton enjoyed
a special share of royal favour. Dr. Goodall, if
he had been an easy-going Headmaster, was in
many respects an ideal Provost, who notoriously
possessed many of the qualifications of a courtier;
whilst Dr. Langford, Lower Master for many years,
was such a favourite with the King that the latter
used to send for him to come down to Weymouth
and preach. The sunshine of royalty in which
Etonians basked not unnaturally aroused some
jealousy; and one critic&mdash;an old Westminster boy&mdash;declared
that the vicinity of Windsor Castle
was of no benefit to the discipline and good order
of Eton School.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GEORGE III. AND THE BOYS</div>

<p>A constant patron of boys and masters, George
III. hardly ever passed the College without stopping
to chat with some of them. He was very
fond of stag-hunting, and as one of the favourite
places for the deer to be thrown off was between
Slough and Langley Broom, he very often came
through Eton; the appearance of the green-tilted
cart about nine o’clock was certain evidence that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the King would pass some time before eleven. It
became a custom for the boys to wait for him
seated on the wall in front of the school. He
generally arrived, escorted by his attendants, the
master of the hounds, and some of the neighbouring
gentry, old Davis, the huntsman, with
the stag-hounds, going on before. Occasionally
the King’s beloved daughter, the Princess Amelia,
whose early death he so deeply deplored, came too.</p>

<p>Near the wall, hat in hand, the Eton boys
greeted their monarch, who almost invariably
stopped to ask various questions of those who
had the good fortune to attract his attention.
These were mostly some of the young nobility,
with whose parents His Majesty was acquainted,
and whom, if once introduced to him, his peculiarly
retentive memory never allowed him to
forget.</p>

<p>Picking out some boy he would jokingly say:</p>

<p>“Well, well, when were you flogged last, eh&mdash;eh?
Your master is very kind to you all, is
he not? Have you had any rebellions lately, eh&mdash;eh?
Naughty boys, you know, sometimes.
Should you not like to have a holiday, if I hear
a good character of you, eh&mdash;eh? Well, well, we
will see about it, but be good boys. Who is to
have the Montem this year?”</p>

<p>On being told he would remark:</p>

<p>“Lucky fellow, lucky fellow.”</p>

<p>The royal visit was a general topic of conversation
during the day, and though one of such frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
occurrence&mdash;nay, almost every week during the
hunting season&mdash;still was it always attended with
delight, and the anticipation of something good
to follow. It was highly amusing to hear the
various remarks made by some of the boys who
happened not to have been present at the time of
the royal cavalcade passing, and who, of course,
were anxious to hear what had occurred.</p>

<p>“Well, what did old George say? Did he
say that he would ask for a holiday for us? By
Jove, I hope that he will, for I want to ride
Steven’s new chestnut to Egham.”</p>

<p>“You be hanged,” a companion would retort;
“I want to go to Langley to see my aunt, who
has promised to give me syllabubs, the first ‘<em>after
four</em>’ that I can go.”</p>

<p>Another perhaps wanted to have a drive to
Virginia Water, a favourite excursion with the
boys. Such and the like expectations of holiday
happiness were as often anticipated, and frequently
realised, by the ride of kindly old George III.
through the town of Eton.</p>

</div>

<p>In a regulation costume of knee-breeches and
black silk stockings (any holes in the latter being
concealed by ink) the Eton boys going up to
the Castle would stroll about the terrace, which,
like the river, was “in bounds” though the
approaches to it were not. There the King mixed
freely with them, asking any one he did not
know by sight, “What’s your name? Who’s
your tutor? Who’s your dame?” And on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
receiving the answer he would generally remark:
“<em>Very</em> good tutor, <em>very</em> good dame.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MONTEM PARADE</div>

<p>On the evening of the picturesque “Montem,”
the terrace was the scene of what was called
“Montem parade,” in which the fantastic costumes
of the boys were conspicuous features. On
one occasion George III. kept all the boys to
supper at the Castle, taking care, however, to
forget all about the masters, who were consequently
annoyed. The old king more than once interfered
to prevent Eton boys from being punished, and
actually gave one offender who had been expelled
for poaching in the Home Park a commission in
the Guards.</p>

<p>William the Fourth also took a great interest
in Eton, as did Queen Victoria, who sometimes
sent for privileged boys. On one occasion she
attended speeches, and all the school considered
it a compliment when she invited Dr. Hawtrey
to tea. In the earlier portion of her reign, whenever
she passed through Eton she was loudly
cheered by the Etonians, and would check the
speed of her carriage out of consideration for
those who ran beside it.</p>

<p>The memory of George III., as every one knows,
is still preserved at Eton by the celebration of
his birthday&mdash;June 4th. What, however, every
one does not know is that the present costume
of the Eton boys&mdash;black jackets and tail coats&mdash;is
in reality but a sort of perpetual mourning for
the old king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of the eighteenth century the
costume of an Etonian consisted of a blue coat,
knee breeches, white waistcoat and ruffled shirt, but
a few years later white ducks and pantaloons began
to be worn by Oppidans, though the Collegers were
compelled to adhere to the older dress for some
time longer.</p>

<p>After 1820 the smaller boys wore jackets and
black slip-knot ties (handkerchiefs they were called
at first), the bigger ones swallow-tailed dress-coats
and spotless white ties. For a considerable period
the latter had no collars, but stiff neckcloths about
a yard long, tied twice round. The first boy who
started a single tie and collar was one of the
master’s sons, and at first the innovation was
regarded with disfavour as much too free-and-easy.
The masters kept a sharp eye upon the boys’ tails,
any one attempting something like a “morning”
coat being at once called to account and told by
his tutor not to “dress himself like a bargeman.”
No objection, however, was made to an indulgence
in studs, bunches of charms, and other jewellery;
and many boys decorated their coats with summer
flowers, in the arrangement of which they showed
some taste.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the nineteenth century
morning coats took the place of the swallow-tails.
Since then, with the exception of a diminution in
the height of the top hat, which in the late fifties of
the last century was preposterous, the dress of
an Etonian has remained pretty well unchanged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
though, of course, from time to time there have
been varying fashions as regards waistcoats. Thirty
years ago the most popular of these were those
made of a sort of corduroy relieved by coloured
silk. At present, I understand, some perturbation
has been caused amongst the upper boys by a
report that the Headmaster proposes to prohibit
every sort of fancy waistcoat; but it is to be hoped
that such an interference with Etonian liberty will
not be carried into effect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FADS</div>

<p>The custom of swells wearing stick-up collars,
instead of the turn-down ones worn by their
undistinguished schoolfellows, is now of some
antiquity and appears likely to last.</p>

<p>Up to about fifty or sixty years ago Eton boys
never wore greatcoats at all. The famous Headmaster,
Dr. Keate, was a warm supporter of this
Spartan habit, which underwent only gradual
modification as time went on; for, even after greatcoats
were allowed the boys very seldom wore them,
and never by any chance put them on unless they
were sure that some of the swells of the school had
given them a lead. So strong is the force of
custom in this matter, that when a few years ago
the Headmaster issued a circular that every boy,
no matter his place in the school, was to wear a
greatcoat whenever he liked, no notice whatever
was taken of it, the old state of affairs continuing
to exist. Another curious usage is that which
ordains that no boy except a swell may carry his
umbrella rolled up, akin to which was the idea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
prevalent thirty years ago, and very likely prevalent
to-day, that turning up the bottom of the trousers
must not be attempted by any but those occupying
a distinguished position in the school.</p>

<p>Before the era of steam, wonderful costumes
were worn by Eton boys as they started away for
the holidays. On Election Monday the whole road
from Barnes Pool Bridge to Weston’s Yard would
be filled with a crowd of vehicles, whilst round
the corner of the Slough Road, where the new
schools now stand, just beyond Spier’s sock shop, a
number of youths, gorgeously dressed in green coats
with brass buttons, white breeches, top-boots and
spurs, would take horse and ride away to town,
much to the admiration of a crowd of lower boys.
At Spier’s, at the corner opposite the entrance to
Weston’s Yard, Collegers were in the habit of
leaving their gowns when going out of bounds
towards Slough. Shelley as an Eton boy was
a great frequenter of this sock shop, where the
excellent brown bread and butter and a pretty
girl, Martha&mdash;the Hebe of Spier’s&mdash;as he called
her, made a great impression upon his youthful mind.</p>

<p>Farther away down Datchet Lane on breaking-up
day, sporting spirits would find traps of various
sorts waiting for them&mdash;tandems were occasionally
driven by Eton boys during the school-time, fags
being taken out to act as tigers on surreptitious
drives to Salt Hill or to Marsh’s Inn at Maidenhead,
once a favourite place of resort on account of the
cock-pit there. On one of these outings in a curricle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
a horse bolted, and the driver, brutalized by terror,
ordered his fag to jump on the horse’s back and
saw at his bit. The foolhardy feat was accomplished,
and the horse stopped, but the small boy’s
arms were almost pulled out of their sockets, and
one of them got badly dislocated. According to
one account it was Mr. Gladstone, then an Eton
boy, who tried to rectify the injury before a doctor
arrived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRADITIONS</div>

<p>The old Eton traditions were essentially aristocratic
in their nature, as was only natural
considering that the vast majority of the boys
sent to the school were of good birth. Whilst
amongst themselves the boys were highly intolerant
of all assumptions of superiority not based upon
the distinctions of good fellowship and physical
prowess, they were rather prone to regard the
rest of the world with easy and good-natured
contempt; indeed they thought themselves the
finest fellows in the world, and little was done
by the authorities to dispel such an idea. According
to a certain standpoint, this, no doubt, was
mere snobbishness, the main object of a favourite
form of modern altruism being to assume that
the lowest is better than the highest, and give
way to everybody no matter who. It is, however,
to be hoped that the latter spirit&mdash;the spirit
of defeat, not of victory&mdash;will not be allowed
to annihilate that individualism and independence
which has ever been held dear by those educated
amidst Eton’s classic shades. In former days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
no doubt, somewhat extravagant respect was paid
to rank; but it must be remembered that the
aristocracy were at that time the real leaders of the
country, and titles not merely honorary labels
purchased by “plebeian money bags,” through contributions
to their party war chests. For the most
part they then carried with them real territorial
power.</p>

<p>In its main features, the Eton of our forefathers
was a true democracy, though one enclosed
in an aristocratic frame. In spite of Socialists and
sentimentalists “all men are born unequal,” and
our ancestors were fully alive to the odious affectation
of ignoring social distinctions which always
have existed, and always must exist in every
society.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BADGE GIVING</div>

<p>The position of noblemen, as they were called
(this included the eldest sons of Peers), at Eton,
then, somewhat resembled that of the gentlemen
commoners at the University. Like the latter,
they had to pay for their privileges, double fees
being exacted from their parents’ pockets. The
privileges in question, it should be added, hurt
nobody. On the festivals of St. Andrew, St.
Patrick, St. David, and, if in the school-time, St.
George, the Headmaster entertained Scotch, Irish,
Welsh or English boys of high birth at breakfast,
and on such days he and the Lower Master wore an
appropriate “badge,” presented to them by the boy
who was highest in rank of the nation which
was celebrating its patron saint. Not infrequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the boy’s tutor was presented with one of these
badges, sometimes quite valuable gifts, costing
five or six pounds apiece. There was no fixed
pattern, the design being always left to the
boy’s own taste, or to that of his parents; care,
however, was taken to introduce the shamrock,
thistle, or leek, according to the day which was
to be celebrated.</p>

<p>The quaint old usage was formerly quite a
feature of the school-time during which it took
place. As late as 1862 a London newspaper gave
an account of its observance. In that year, on
St. Patrick’s day, Lord Langford, as the highest
Irish nobleman who was an Eton boy at the
time, presented badges of St. Patrick, beautifully
embroidered in silver, to the Headmaster, the
Reverend E. Balston, and to the Lower Master,
the Reverend W. Carter, both of whom wore
these badges throughout the day. On the same
date, according to ancient custom, twenty-four
noblemen and gentlemen, as they were termed&mdash;that
is to say, Eton boys&mdash;attended a great
breakfast given by the Headmaster.</p>

<p>Why such an inoffensive and pretty custom
was ever allowed to become obsolete it is difficult
to understand.</p>

<p>According to one account, the individual responsible
for the discontinuance was the late Duke
of Sutherland, who, when it came to the turn of
his son, Lord Stafford, to present the badge, discouraged
him from carrying out the old usage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
which he branded as mere nonsense. Probably the
cost of the badges contributed to the discontinuance
of their presentation. It seems a pity that
a fixed pattern worth some trifling sum was not
adopted in order to prevent extravagance.</p>

<p>Though the badges seem still to have been
given up to the middle sixties of the last century,
by 1879&mdash;amongst the boys at least&mdash;all tradition
of anything of the sort had died away. One
who had been at Eton about 1866 told the
writer that he had a vague remembrance of hearing
of the custom, but it had then ceased to be
observed.</p>

<p>It should be added that Dr. Hawtrey, in his
monument in the College Chapel, is represented
wearing the badge of Scotland and the motto
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nemo me impune lacessit</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRIVATE TUTORS</div>

<p>Till about 1835, noblemen who came to Eton
usually brought private tutors with them, and
boarded at dames: they were not obliged to have
school tutors. The most distinguished of these
private tutors would appear to have been John
Moultrie, who in 1822 acted in this capacity to
Lord Craven, who three years later presented
him with the living of Rugby. As a youthful
Colleger Moultrie had shown considerable poetic
power, and had he died at an early age speculation
might have been busy as to the great poems which
English literature had lost through his death. His
early reputation rested chiefly on “My Brother’s
Grave,” in the style of Byron’s “Prisoner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Chillon,” first published in the College Magazine
and then in the <cite>Etonian</cite>. Often reprinted since,
it is probably the most widely read of his writings.
He was a warm lover of Eton, and paid a fine
tribute of affection to his old school in an introduction
to an edition of Gray. Bringing private
tutors to Eton seems to have entailed considerably
great cost, for the Duke of Atholl told
William Evans that his expenses under this system
were £1000 a year! Dr. Hawtrey, it was, who
made the rule that every boy should have a
school tutor, after which the custom of bringing
private tutors practically ceased. Even in the
sixties, however, it survived in a modified way.
Lord Blandford, Lord Lorne, his brother, Lord
Archibald Campbell, and his cousin, Lord Ronald
Leveson Gower, all had private tutors&mdash;the last
three, indeed, lived with one in a house by themselves.
George Monckton, afterwards Lord Galway,
who was at Eton about the same time, also
enjoyed the same dubious advantage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHAPEL</div>

<p>As has already been mentioned at <a href="#Ref_28">page 28</a>, up
to about 1845, boys who were noblemen, sons of
peers or baronets, sat in the stalls (ruthlessly torn
down during the so-called “restoration” of 1845-47)
at the west end of the chapel, near the Provost and
Headmaster; and, according to custom, a newcomer
distributed packets of almonds and raisins to his
companions in the other seats of honour. Originally,
it would seem, this curious usage was limited
to the Sixth Form boys, who also followed it when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
for the first time they took their places as such.
Considerable obscurity, however, surrounds the
whole subject of “chapel sock,” as it was called;
probably it was the continuance of some medieval
custom, the meaning of which had disappeared ages
before. The eating of almonds and raisins during
divine worship seems very strange to those of a later
generation; in former times, however, it must be
remembered the chapel was sometimes used for
other purposes besides the celebration of services.
The election of the College Fellows, for instance,
took place there, and sometimes some of the
electors tucked themselves up as well as they could
and went to sleep. The general tone of the school
up to about seventy years ago was not very
religious, or, it is to be feared, very reverent;
there was, indeed, too much chapel and too little
devotion.</p>

<p>Two long collegiate services on Sundays and
whole holidays, and one on every half-holiday,
made the boys tired of the whole thing. New
boys sometimes did take prayer-books in with
them the first Sunday, but never ventured to defy
public opinion to that extent a second time. Some
of the Upper School were nearly nineteen years old,
but amongst them taking the sacrament was almost
unheard of. The chaplain (or “Conduct” as he
was called) often misconducted himself by gabbling
and skipping&mdash;whilst the masters, perched in desks
aloft, kept themselves just awake by watching
boys whom they “spited.” The boys themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
had their own resources wherewith “to palliate
dullness, and give time a shove.” Kneeling with
head down, as if in deep devotion, many a one of
them contrived to carve his initials on his seat
without being observed, and very few took the least
interest in the service. As for the interminable
sermons, those they frankly disliked and despised,
the preachers being generally prosy and sometimes
incoherent. As a fellow of some originality said in
one of his quaint discourses, the hearts of the boys
were like gooseberry tarts without sugar, and the
vast majority took little trouble to conceal their
dislike for chapel during the “restoration,” when
the school attended service in a temporary building.
The forms on which they sat there being somewhat
flimsy, every effort was made to smash as
many as possible, in order that boys might have
an excuse for absenting themselves owing to lack
of seats.</p>

<p>Most of the congregation looked upon the enormously
lengthy services as so much extra school
and took no interest in the responses, for years
uttered by an old clerk named Gray, who was an
Eton institution dating from 1809. With the
lapse of years he had become somewhat deaf, and
consequently made occasional blunders which were
a constant source of amusement. Especially did
his hearers delight in old Gray’s performances on
certain festivals, such as the service for the queen’s
accession, when he generally canonized her twice in
the same verse of the Psalm. “And blessed be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the name of Her Majesty for ever, and all the
earth shall be full of Her Majesty.”</p>

<p>On the whole, the service was not conducted in
a very reverent or attractive manner, and the impression
which it would have seemed to convey
was that every one, including the “Conduct,” was
anxious to get through it as quickly as possible.
A great day, however, was Oak Apple day,
when the picturesque old service in memory of
the Restoration of Charles II. was duly gone
through, all the boys sporting oak leaves as a
memento of the Merry Monarch of joyous memory.
On all other occasions, however, the services
proceeded with monotonous and unvarying regularity,
which more or less still prevailed in the
writer’s Eton days thirty years ago, though at
that time they had been considerably brightened
and no irreverence prevailed.</p>

<p>The chapel bell always stopped five minutes
before the hour, but the Provost and Fellows
never made their appearance till just as the clock
struck; it seemed to be the object of all the bigger
boys in the school to come in as nearly as possible
at the same time as the College authorities did,
yet without running it so fine as to cause a disagreeable
rush at the last moment. These loiterers,
always the “swells” of the school, took their
places just before the entry upon their heels of
the Sixth Form boys, who always headed the
procession, which was closed by the Provost. His
entry was the signal for the commencement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the service, and the “Conduct” or chaplain whose
turn it was at once began. Everything was got
through at a pretty good pace, though after about
1840 no slovenliness was to be observed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A FATAL SQUIB</div>

<p>From time to time, of course, even in the days
when irreverence was common, the boys were
moved by some extraordinary service which impressed
the most unthinking minds. One of these
occasions was the funeral service of a boy named
Grieve, son of the English physician to the Czar
of Russia, at the commencement of the nineteenth
century. On the 5th of November, then a
day of much riot at Eton, poor Grieve had filled
his pockets with what proved to him the instruments
of death, in order to enjoy the frolics of the
evening, which were suddenly ended when a young
nobleman unluckily “squibbed,” as it was called, his
unfortunate friend. Some of the fireworks which
were in his pocket immediately ignited, which,
communicating to the rest their deadly errand,
exploded, and literally tore off a portion of flesh
from his bones. The poor fellow’s screams were
dreadful, and he died in four days’ time.</p>

<p>This sad affair threw a gloom over the school
for a long time, and games and sports were almost
forgotten. When the day came for Grieve’s
burial, its awe was strongly augmented by the
solemnity with which the funeral service (that
most beautiful and sublime selection of prayers)
was read by the headmaster, Dr. Goodall; indeed,
among the whole body of upwards of five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
boys, not a dry eye was to be seen. One of these
has left on record how to his dying day he could
never forget the impression made on his mind,
when, with a trembling anticipation of the approaching
procession, he heard the first words, “I
am the resurrection and the life,” and his poignant
emotion as the funeral procession slowly wound
into the chapel and the sky-blue coffin<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> broke upon
his sight.</p>

<p>An old Eton Sunday institution was “prose,”
held in Upper School, where the Headmaster
would read a few pithy moral sentences. As a
rule it is to be feared these were pearls thrown
before swine, and the swine-herd seemed to feel
disgusted as he threw them. He then gave out
the subjects of exercises for the ensuing week,
and informed the boys what would be the amount
of holidays in it.</p>

<p>In the old days a number of the Eton masters
were not the earnest men who are to be found in
the school to-day. At a time when the aristocracy
possessed great power, it was not extraordinary
that young noblemen should have been treated
with a great measure of leniency. A certain tutor,
for instance, behaved with great philosophy when
one of his pupils, belonging to a great family, rolled
him down the hundred steps, and reaped the reward
by afterwards rising to a position of high
eminence in the Church. Not a few masters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
were shackled by hide-bound conservatism, whilst
a certain type of eighteenth century pedagogue
was quite unfitted to inculcate learning.</p>

<p>It is not fair to criticise the old Eton masters
too severely, but undoubtedly some were incompetent.
They were quite content that matters
should proceed as they understood they had proceeded
in the past, and thought it no part of their
duty to attempt improvement in the time-honoured
curriculum which for generations had been in
vogue at “Eton School.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A BABY OPPIDAN</div>

<p>In the early twenties of the nineteenth century,
boys who were mere children, hardly out of petticoats,
were sent to Eton in order that they might
gradually work their way up and get to King’s.
Oppidans also were then very young, a child aged
four and a half being admitted in 1820. At that
time a boy could rise to the top of the school
merely by seniority, due importance not being
attached to hard work and sound scholarship.
The “trials” were then more or less nominal, but
the curious thing is, that in spite of all this Eton
produced some very fine classical scholars, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the vast majority of the boys were better acquainted
with Latin and Greek than their successors
who went to Eton when a more exacting
curriculum came into force. In 1827 there were
no examinations after the Fifth Form was reached,
nor any distinction attainable except that of being
sent up “for good,” the reward for which then
was a sovereign, and every third time, a book.</p>

<p>When a master came across some peculiarly
good set of verses he would send them up to the
Headmaster “for good”; in due course the writer
would be called up by the Head, who would
compliment him and read out the lines to the
assembled boys in Upper School. A guinea was
afterwards given to the boy by his dame. Sending
up “for good” seems now on the increase, but in
my own school-days one seldom heard of any one
achieving such a distinction, whilst sending up
“for play” was rarer still. In the past, getting
into Sixth Form did not change an Eton
boy’s life nearly so much as it does to-day. True,
he had his seat in the stalls in chapel, and
came into church later than any one else except
the Provost and Fellows; in Upper School on
certain public occasions, he had also the honour
of making speeches. Beyond this, however, and
the release from shirking the masters, his position
was in no wise altered or improved.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago Eton in respect to school work
somewhat resembled an oriental state in which
the first symptoms of modernisation are beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to appear. In the main the old classical traditions
commanded a rigid adherence, boys with a
totally insufficient knowledge of Greek being by
a polite fiction supposed to be able to construe
Homer with ease, whilst dunces who could not
write a sentence in correct English were every
week obliged to show up a copy of Latin verses.
The wonder is how all this was ever done at all,
but done it was; and, considering the vast ignorance
of the majority, who frankly regarded the
whole thing with a sort of good-humoured contempt,
done fairly well. Perhaps this was in no
small degree owing to the fact that in almost
every house there was some easy-going clever
boy who, having received a good grounding at a
private school, was able and ready to help his less
gifted schoolfellows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MAP MAKING</div>

<p>One of the great features of school work was
the execution of a map once every week, illustrating
various countries as they were in classical
times. Occasionally boys with a turn for drawing
would decorate the margins of their maps with
some fanciful device. As a rule, the masters
extended a good-humoured toleration to this
practice, which often bore some reference to current
events. At the time when a coming prize-fight
was exciting great interest in sporting circles,
a boy decorated the top of his map with portraits
of the two fistic heroes of the day. This,
however, was little appreciated by his master.
A more clever form of decoration was the picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of an eight-oar manned by masters and steered
by Dr. Keate which a clever pupil of the Doctor
drew in the middle of the Mediterranean with
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gens inimica mihi Tyrrhenum navigat aequor</i>
inscribed beneath the boat. All the maps were
shown up on the same day, when “Map Morning,”
as it was called, filled the school yard.</p>

<p>The old system of sending mere children to
Eton lasted up to about half a century ago. In
1857 boys went still there as young as nine or
ten, nor was it uncommon to see children of
seven or eight in the Lower School. Many stayed
at Eton till they were eighteen, after having
worked their way up from the First Form to
Doctor’s Division, at the rate of two removes a
year&mdash;a process which, including three years’
inevitable stoppage in Upper Fifth, required more
than ten years to accomplish. In the school list
for Election, 1834, Lower School has shrunk to
a very small number. The first part of it,
Third Form, contains but three boys; the second
division, seven. “Sense” and “Nonsense,” which
come next, have but six between them; there
is no one in Second Form, and in First Form
only two.</p>

<p>Up to the early ’sixties of the last century,
certain divisions of Third Form retained some quaint
old titles&mdash;the first sections being called Upper
Greek, Lower Greek, “Sense” and “Nonsense.”
Lower Remove, Upper and Lower Remove in the
Second Form and First Form completed the tail-end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of the school. “Sense” and “Nonsense,” it
should be added, received their quaint titles because
boys in the latter were doomed to a sort of
“poetical purgatory,” and only wrote “nonsense”
verses; that is, Latin compositions which scanned
as verse, but contained no ideas; in which respect
the effusions in question resembled the productions
of some living bards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOWER SCHOOL</div>

<p>When Mr. John Hawtrey was an Eton master,
Lower School, somewhat altering its constitution,
became larger again; the boys in it, mostly very
young, being all together in his house at the corner
of Keate’s Lane, where he kept what was practically
a private school apart. His boys were not allowed
the same amount of liberty as those in other
houses: they took breakfast and tea in common,
and generally played their games in Mr. Hawtrey’s
private field. On reaching the Upper School they
usually went to other houses.</p>

<p>The curriculum of Lower School was entirely
different from that followed by the Upper Forms.
In “Nonsense” the boys, besides being taught to
write nonsense verses, grappled with intricacies of
the old “Eton Latin Grammar.” After this they
were promoted to “Sense,” when the nonsense
verses were discarded; Lower Greek and Upper
Greek did very elementary work.</p>

<p>After Mr. John Hawtrey had left Eton to set
up a preparatory school at Aldin House, Slough,
Lower School once more became small. In
1868, just previous to its abolition, it contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
69 boys. The school list had then ceased to
give the old terms, Upper Greek, “Sense,” and
“Nonsense.” Shortly after First and Second Forms
were abolished and Fourth Form placed under
control of the Lower Master, the Reverend
Francis Edward Durnford, so well known as
“Judy” to several generations of Etonians. Third
Form still continued to exist in the writer’s
day (1879 to 1883); but it then seldom contained
more than two or three boys. Since that time it
has varied in number, sometimes amounting to
ten or a dozen, or, as at present (1911), eight.
It is interesting to note that there are now more
than sixty assistant masters, as compared with
ten in 1834. In the same time the number of
boys at Eton has more than doubled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHIRKING</div>

<p>Up to the end of the nineteenth century there
was a glaring inconsistency in various unwritten
regulations which ruled the Eton boy out of
school. Certain ordinances were seemingly
moulded upon an Hibernian model, many things
being forbidden in theory though allowed in
practice. Up to 1860 everything beyond Barnes
Pool Bridge was considered out of bounds, though
the river and terrace of Windsor Castle were not.
The boys, of course, went up town freely, most
of the shops they used being in the High Street
beyond the bridge, and so the ridiculous custom
of “shirking” grew up. When an Eton boy up
town perceived a master he would get behind a
lamp-post or rush into a shop, the merest pretext<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of concealment from view being, as a rule, sufficient
to prevent the “beak” from taking any notice
of him, for it was not etiquette for masters to
see boys, provided “shirking” was observed. A
number of extraordinary usages prevailed in connection
with the somewhat senseless custom. For
instance, it was not the thing for a master to turn
round to look out for a boy following behind&mdash;the
whole system was ludicrous. One boy, seeing a
master enter a confectioner’s shop, where he was
eating an ice, escaped notice by shutting one eye
and holding up the spoon in front of the other!</p>

<p>At one time Sixth Form boys had to be
“shirked” like the masters, but this seems to
have been very laxly observed, “liberties,” that
is to say exemptions, being often granted.</p>

<p>Another great inconsistency was that though
by the laws of the school, no Eton boy might
enter the Christopher, there were very few Etonians
who were not thoroughly acquainted with the
interior of the old town, where at one time Upper
boys had regular dinners which were known to the
whole school.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WINDSOR FAIR</div>

<p>Though “shirking” as a general rule ensured
a boy’s immunity from punishment when out of
bounds, it ceased to exercise its charm at Windsor
Fair (abolished about 1871), which was strictly
prohibited. Nevertheless, the boys attended it
in flocks, part of their amusement consisting in
dodging the masters.</p>

<p>It was highly characteristic of the old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Eton system, that though the Fair was strictly
forbidden, no efforts at all were made to prevent
boys from going there, though they were often
severely punished if caught. Not a few of the
masters, however, almost openly tolerated such
transgressions, and a few even made a point of
giving their pupils double pocket-money in Fair
week. It must be remembered that at that time all
the masters were old Etonians, having passed their
lives between the school and King’s. Consequently
they were generally imbued with the old
traditions, and had never come across any external
influences likely to alter a point of view adopted
when they themselves were being trained by
masters of an old-fashioned Conservative type.</p>

<p>At the Fair a large quantity of pocket-money
was expended at the various booths, the keepers
of which, of course, at once recognised an Eton boy,
whom all the professional tricksters of the place
looked upon as their surest game. Every device
was put before him, and all sorts of temptations
held out to induce him to stop and have a trial,
as they called it, of his luck. Cards, rings, coins,
everything in fact was made into an instrument
for gaining a little money during this harvest of
inexperience.</p>

<p>The rifle gallery, where they gave two shots for
a penny, was a favourite resort, and every stall
which the boys passed, whatever was the sort of
trumpery with which it was filled, formed an
excuse for loitering to examine what there was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Dolls and knives and penny trumpets and rattles,
all required attention; boxes and brooches were
haggled over, and rings, and even rags, minutely
inspected.</p>

<p>The Fair consisted of a number of booths
stretching from the Town Hall to Castle Yard.
There were the usual shows, and in the eighteenth
century a bull bait on Bachelors’ Acre, the place
of which, in latter years, was taken by roulette.
This game, of course, run by doubtful characters,
was highly attractive to certain venturesome
Etonians&mdash;there was real danger in it, for a boy
caught playing was turned down to a lower form
as well as whipped.</p>

<p>Though many boys were flogged for going to this
October festival, it was always a source of great
delight to the school, for it gave rise to many jokes.</p>

<p>It was a common practice for boys to purchase
all sorts of mechanical toys&mdash;jumping frogs and the
like&mdash;there, and surreptitiously introduce them
upon some master’s desk. On one occasion, a
perfect menagerie was successfully planted on the
table before Dr. Hawtrey’s very nose, and all the
punishment the culprits received for their tomfoolery
was his withering remark, “Babies!”</p>

<p>As late as the beginning of the nineteenth
century the old Windsor Theatre was often visited
by Etonians. The gallery, indeed, seems to have
been more or less reserved for their use. By the
middle of the century, however, the boys had
long ceased to indulge in this amusement, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
up to the late seventies a considerable number
frequented Windsor races, at that time an open
meeting.</p>

<p>In 1879, the writer’s first year at Eton, an idea
prevailed that if we could run there and back
without missing Absence, such a visit was not
forbidden. Be this as it may, the writer, with
a friend, did run there and back, the only unpleasant
consequence being the loss of some pocket-money.
In the following year, besides the notice
prohibiting boys from being on the Windsor bank
of the river during the races (which, nevertheless,
did not prevent a considerable number from
crossing over), drastic measures were taken by the
authorities to prevent Etonians from going there
on foot, which, owing to the vigilance of masters
in Windsor, had to be abandoned altogether.
It was no unheard-of thing for a boy in those
days to run to Ascot races and get back in time
for Absence&mdash;then at six. This, of course, was
contrived by getting lifts on the way, and though
some were caught and punished, quite a number
indulged in what was to them an exciting adventure.
Two or three got to the races by
assuming a disguise, whilst others were picked up
and hidden in carriages and traps by obliging elder
brothers or old Etonians. One boy&mdash;Bathurst by
name&mdash;according to current report, so tickled
young Lady Savernake by his impersonation of a
nigger-minstrel that she gave him a £5 piece.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PIG FAIR</div>

<p>In Eton itself up to the ’thirties of the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
century, every Ash Wednesday there was held a
Pig Fair, just outside Upper School; this, of course,
led to great disorder&mdash;the boys delighting in letting
the pigs loose, and chasing them in all directions.
At the last of these Fairs in Keate’s time, a boy
actually rode a pig from the gate of Weston’s Yard
to the Christopher, at the identical moment when
Keate came out of Keate’s Lane on the way to
chapel, his gown flying in the wind. Keate took
little notice of this at the time, merely remarking,
“Pigs will squeak, and boys will laugh; don’t do it
again.”</p>

<p>When Gladstone was a boy at Eton, considerable
brutality existed in connection with the Fair. The
boys, according to old custom, hustling the drovers
and then cutting off the tails of the pigs. Gladstone
boldly denounced such cruelty, and gave
considerable offence by declaring that the boys who
were foremost in this kind of butchery were the
first to quake at the consequences of detection.
He dared them, if they were proud of their work,
to sport the trophies of it in their hats. On the
following Ash Wednesday he found three newly
amputated pig-tails hung in a bunch on his door,
with a paper inscribed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquotebase">“Quisquis amat porcos, porcis amabitur illis;
</div><div class="indentone">Cauda sit exemplum ter repetita tibi.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Underneath these lines the future Prime Minister
wrote a challenge to the pig-torturers, inviting
them to come forward and take a receipt for their
offering, which he would mark “in good round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
hand upon your faces.” The pig-baiting, however,
continued till Dr. Hawtrey did away with the Fair.</p>

<p>Even in the rough old times the life of the
Oppidans was pleasant enough; a totally different
state of affairs prevailing amongst them from that
which flourished in Long Chamber, where small
collegers were so roughly treated that many of them
preferred to be Oppidans till such time as they had
attained a place in the school which would
guarantee them against being bullied.</p>

<p>Amongst the Oppidans, indeed, there would
seem never to have been any bullying at all, whilst
their health and comfort was looked after pretty
much as it is to-day. Nevertheless, in old days,
they had a far greater knowledge of the stern facts
of life than is at present the case. Their rambles
round the slums of Windsor&mdash;visits to the Fair and
contact with the rough and undesirable characters
of the vicinity&mdash;taught them what human nature
really is, while the fighting, which was then
recognised, precluded all trace of namby-pambyism.
In those days Eton sent forth few sentimentalists
into the great world, but it undoubtedly furnished
England with the very best type of officer to meet
the enemy in the Peninsular and at Waterloo.
It was an era when the sickening cant of humanitarianism,
born of luxury and weakness, had not yet
arisen to emasculate and enfeeble the British race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAGGING</div>

<p>Fagging at Eton seems never to have degenerated
into brutality. In former times, however,
fags had to perform many services which sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
strange to modern ears. An Etonian, for instance,
who had been fag to the future Wellington, it is
said, used to declare that the chief service he had
to perform was that of bed-warmer, for the Fifth
Form then made the Lower boys lie for a time in
their beds to take off the chill. This story, however,
is probably legendary, fagging amongst the
Oppidans having generally been limited to getting
breakfasts from sock shops, taking messages, and
cooking. Fag-masters have seldom been anything
but considerate, and the old joke of sending a green
newcomer (after his first fortnight of immunity
from fagging) to Layton’s, the confectioner on
Windsor Hill, for a pennyworth of pigeon milk, has
probably never been put into practice.</p>

<p>As long as a hundred years ago cases of bullying
out of College were sternly repressed by the boys
themselves. At that time a great sensation was
caused because a boy high in the Fifth Form flicked
with a wet towel the bare back of his fag, who
complained after Absence to the captain of the
school. The circumstances soon got wind, and
nearly the whole school followed the captain to the
bully’s dame’s, which was Raguineau’s. He was
pulled out of his room, and most soundly horsewhipped
close by one of the large elms, to the
delight of all.</p>

<p>Though the accommodation was not uncomfortable,
the boys’ rooms were then, as a rule, smaller and
less luxurious than is the case to-day, the windows
being often barred like those of a prison or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
lunatic asylum. The furniture was all of the
commonest wood, and consisted of a table, two
chairs (well carved by preceding generations), a
bureau&mdash;a sort of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">multum in parvo</i> for books,
clothes, and everything else&mdash;and a large press
which turned into a bed; this, small boys always
regarded with misgiving, it being a practice for
raiding parties to shut the occupier up in it.</p>

<p>In 1825 some of the rooms were as small as five
feet by six, some were not carpeted, and a few of
those on the ground floor were unpleasant owing
to the contents of pails descending from the upper
windows.</p>

<p>On the fifth of November the Lower boys revenged
their wrongs by making a bonfire of their
Greek grammars in the school-yard; and later in
the year, when the snow came, they would industriously
collect it in the house, in order that
in the evening they might overwhelm some little
fellow and his books with a pile of it.</p>

<p>Very early rising was then the rule, and in
winter boys got up by candle-light. The Fourth
Form had an infliction called “Long-morning.”
They had to be in school by half-past seven, but
when the masters overslept themselves there was a
“run”&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> no school. At the beginning of the
eighteenth century there was an earlier school still,
at six o’clock.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NICKNAMES</div>

<p>Nicknames have always been popular at Eton,
many of them enduring in after-life. Thomas
James, who in 1766 wrote an account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
school, was nicknamed Mordecai and Pasteboard,
whilst the three brothers Pott were called Quart,
Pint, and Gill.</p>

<p>About the middle of the eighteenth century
nicknames both for masters and boys were very
common. Certain masters were then called Pernypopax
Dampier, Gronkey Graham, Pogy Roberts,
Buck Ekins, Bantam Sumner, and Wigblock Prior.
The following are some boys’ nicknames:&mdash;Bacchus
Browning (Earl Powis), Square Buckeridge, Tiger
Clive, King Cole, Mother and Hoppy Cotes,
Damme Duer, Dapper Dubery, Baboon FitzHugh,
Chob and Chuff Hunter, Toby Liddell, Squashey
Pollard, Codger Praed, Hog Weston, Gobbo
Young, and Woglog Calley.</p>

<p>In old days many Eton nicknames were superior,
and often elegantly classical. At one time a boy
named M’Guire was well known in the school,
because, if prizes had been given for knock-knees
he would have carried off the first prize anywhere.
Homer has a stock of phrases with which he is apt
to fill up his verse, just as lawyers use “common
forms” for their prose. One of these, frequently
occurring in the description of a hero, is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phaidima
guia</i> (beautiful limbs), and Paddy M’Guire bore the
appropriate name of “Phaidima Guia.”</p>

<p>A peculiarly happy nickname was Lapis Lazuli
or Cornelius a lapide, applied to a boy (Newcastle
scholar), in after-life well known to Etonians as
the Rev. E. D. Stone. He recently contributed
some most interesting recollections of Eton to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
attractive book written by Mr. Christopher Stone,
his son.</p>

<p>One of the most apt nicknames ever bestowed
on any boy was Verd Antique, applied to the eldest
of five brothers Green, who were at Eton at the
same time&mdash;the other four being known as Maximus,
Major, Minor, and Minimus.</p>

<p>Slang, though fairly prevalent then, in later
years was of a different kind. It would appear that
Eton boys did not then say “burry” for “bureau,”
nor “brolly” for “umbrella,” whilst “footer” for
“football” was unknown. A favourite old Eton
colloquialism, “con,” a word equivalent in its
meaning to chum and pal, has now long died out,
whilst “pec” used for money was about obsolete
thirty years ago. “Scug,” an untidy boy, and
“scuggish,” bad form, words which were constantly
in the mouths of Etonians of two or three
generations back, are now, I believe, much less
used by Upper boys. “Sock,” a term denoting all
kinds of dainties, still exists, but masters are called
“ushers” instead of “beaks.” “Gig,” an old piece
of Eton slang which comprehended all that was
ridiculous, all that was to be laughed at and
plagued, has long ceased to be used.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DAMES AND TUTORS</div>

<p>A curious and old-fashioned word once in constant
use amongst Eton boys, but now quite
obsolete, was “brozier”&mdash;this indicated a boy who
had spent his pocket-money, and was without means
of obtaining “sock.” Brozier was also used in
connection with a disconcerting manœuvre sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
executed by boys at the expense of a dame.
When one of these ladies had gained the reputation
of not providing sufficient food at the usual meals,
and of keeping an ill-stocked larder, an organised
attempt would be made to eat her “out of house
and home”&mdash;as the supply of provisions became
exhausted, more would be demanded in the most
pointed manner&mdash;this was known as “Brozier my
dame.”</p>

<p>One of these ladies, possessed of great strength
of mind and resource, being exposed to a determined
attempt of this kind, turned the tide just
as her boys&mdash;though nearly choked in the moment
of victory&mdash;were winning the battle. Whispering
two words to her maid, the latter disappeared only
to return with an enormous cheese, as strong as
it was big. This the dame cut away liberally,
saying with a smile, that it must not be spared,
for there was another bigger one handy. The
boys never tried a brozier with her again. This
lady had a happy knack of managing her boys,
and after getting them flogged relentlessly on
slight provocation, would, in spite of themselves,
laugh them out of all ill-humour.</p>

<p>The earliest “Tutor’s” house on record seems
to have been kept by W. H. Roberts, a master
who took a few pupils in 1760. When the
eighteenth century had got fairly under way,
the Oppidans were in all probability distributed
amongst “dames” and tutors in much the same
way as has prevailed in recent times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Of late, however, a dame has come to be merely
the technical name of a house-master who has no
regular “division” or class in the school. They are
often mathematical masters, or teachers of special
subjects. In old days many ladies used to keep
boarding-houses for the boys, which of course
gave rise to the name of “dame.” Miss Evans,
who died in 1906, was the last of these. She was
universally respected and beloved, and occupied
a unique position in Eton life,&mdash;her name will long
survive.</p>

<p>One of the most celebrated dames of other
days was Miss Angelo, a pretty woman who, it
is said, was made an Eton dame owing to the
good offices of George the Fourth when Prince of
Wales. This lady’s pony chaise and fur tippet were
familiar to several generations of Etonians, among
whom she bore the nickname of the Duchess of
Eton. She belonged to the famous family which
furnished four generations of fencing-masters to
the school.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEAVING BOOKS</div>

<p>Old Eton was full of peculiar customs&mdash;bad,
good, and indifferent. Amongst the latter was
the giving of Leaving-Books. Often a popular
boy would go away from Eton with quite a
fine little library of these, and towards the end of
each school-time there was some rivalry and
excitement about these collections. Williams’
(the bookseller) shop became resplendent at such
times, the books being all handsomely bound and
mostly gilt, and varying in price from a guinea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
upwards. Eventually, however, the gifts became
absurdly numerous, and in 1868 the custom was
abolished by Dr. Hornby&mdash;mainly, I believe, on
the score of economy. It might have been better,
perhaps, to have limited the price of the books,
for these gifts were productive of kindly feelings.
The receiver always shook hands with the donor
and requested him to write his name in the book,
and the collection formed a pleasant remembrance
of Eton in after years, and a memorial of friendship
with schoolfellows.</p>

<p>Every boy who gave a leaving-book had to be
thanked and shaken hands with. And in the last
week of the Half boys came and wrote their names
in their respective books “after two,” when those
leaving Eton were expected to be in their rooms,
where various dainties were provided. After the
names had been signed there was more shaking of
hands.</p>

<p>Another old usage, now very rightly abolished,
was “Leaving-Money.” In former days an
Oppidan, as he said good-bye to the Headmaster,
would leave, in an envelope, a sum, the amount
of which depended upon the generosity of his
parents.</p>

<p>The recognised method for a boy to present
this donation was to hold the envelope inside his
hat, which he would place for a moment on the
table, and so unostentatiously deposit his offering.</p>

<p>The position of a Headmaster receiving such
gifts was rather awkward, and Dr. Hawtrey, a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of great delicacy and refinement of manner, used
to ignore them as far as was possible. At the end
of the Summer Half, he would observe, “It’s
rather warm, I think I’ll open the window,” and
as he did so, the envelope was furtively laid upon
the table. When the next boy who was leaving
was ushered in, the same process was gone through,
except that the Doctor would observe, “Don’t
you think it’s rather cold? I think I’d better
shut the window.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LONG GLASS</div>

<p>A distinctly bad old custom, which prevailed up
to quite recent times, was the draining of the
“Long Glass” at Tap&mdash;that curious Eton institution
where the Upper part of the school are still allowed
to obtain chops, steaks, bread and cheese, beer
and cider. Though the long glass is still preserved,
I believe it has not been used for many a
long year, a circumstance which can arouse nothing
but gratification amongst all sensible people.</p>

<p>At one time there was “Long-Glass” drinking
once or twice a week during the Summer Half.
Nearly a yard long, and holding a quart, the glass
in question somewhat resembles a coach-horn
with a bulb instead of an opening at the large
end. Aspirants to the honour of draining it
attended in an upper room of Tap after two, each
with a napkin tied round his neck. The object
was to drain the glass without removing it from
the lips, and without spilling any of its contents,
which was extremely hard, for when the contents
of the tubular portion of the glass had been sucked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
down, the beer in the globe would remain for a
moment as if congealed there; and if the glass
was tilted up a little, and shaken, the beer would
give a gurgle and suddenly splutter all over his
face and clothes. Only by holding the Long Glass
at a certain angle could a catastrophe be avoided.</p>

<p>The results of this rather disgusting practice
were often to be clearly discerned on the coats and
waistcoats of boys emerging from Tap, and it is
to be hoped that, unlike some other old Eton
customs which deserve revival, it will remain merely
a memory of a more intemperate age.</p>

<h2>III<br />
DR. KEATE&mdash;<br />
FLOGGING AND FIGHTING</h2>


<p>At the end of the eighteenth century the Eton
boys had become somewhat difficult to control.
Heath and Goodall had both been Headmasters
fond of comfort and ease, and in order to keep
things from drifting into a state of open disorder,
ignored many infractions of discipline. In consequence
of this they both enjoyed a fair measure
of personal popularity&mdash;the parents would seem to
have known little about what was going on, for,
in spite of the continued deterioration in discipline,
the numbers of the school continued to rise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. KEATE</div>

<p>When Keate became Headmaster in 1809, he
found himself confronted by a somewhat difficult
situation. A man of unflinching character, he had
at first to suffer for the weakness of his predecessors
and, owing to his stern methods, incurred
unpopularity which it took some time to efface.</p>

<p>No one who had ever come in contact with
Keate ever forgot him, for his appearance was
exceedingly striking. He was a small man,
little more than five feet high, short-necked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
short-legged, thick-set, powerful, and very active,
whilst within his small frame was concentrated
the pluck of ten battalions. His countenance
resembled that of a bull-dog, and he also
had something of that animal’s mouth. Indeed,
it was said in the school that old Keate could pin
and hold a bull with his teeth. His iron sway
was to many a very unpleasant change, after the
long, mild reign of Dr. Goodall, whose temper,
character, and conduct corresponded precisely with
his name, and under whom Keate had been master
of the Lower School. He was at first, there can
be little doubt, too severe; discipline, wholesome
and necessary in moderation, being carried by him
to an excess; on one morning alone he is said to
have flogged eighty boys. Flogging, indeed, may
be said to have been the head and front, or rather
the head and tail, of his system. Like Dr. Busby,
the famous Headmaster of Westminster School,
he never spoilt the child by sparing the rod.
According to Dr. Johnson, Busby used to call
that instrument of correction his sieve, and declare
that whoever did not pass through it was no
boy for him. Keate, although rigid, rough, and
despotical, was on the whole not unjust, nor
devoid of kindness, a proof of which is that, after
twenty-five years, he retired fairly triumphant,
applauded and respected by the vast majority of
those with whom he had come in contact. During
one of the frequent visits which he paid to Eton
after his retirement, his grim old face was seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
looking down on the boats in Boveney Lock,
whereupon the crews stood up and cheered their
old master with a will.</p>

<p>Much has been written of the curious appearance
of the famous Headmaster, who has been said
to have worn a fancy dress partly resembling the
costume of Napoleon and partly that of a widow
woman. This was a great exaggeration. It is
true he wore a huge cocked hat; this was not from
eccentricity, but because he was a Conservative
and respected tradition&mdash;it had long been the
custom for the Head- and Lower-Masters at Eton
to wear such a head-dress, and Keate merely
retained it after it had become obsolete with the
rest of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ROUGH OLD DAYS</div>

<p>As a rule the famous Headmaster wore an angry
look, whilst ever ready to explode into a rage,
though occasionally flashes of unexpected good-nature
would temper his attitude of unwavering
severity. This, however, was seldom, his command
over his good temper being so complete that he
scarcely ever allowed it to appear. On the other
hand he could not be put out of humour, being
always in the ill-humour which he thought fitting
for a Headmaster. He had a fine voice, which he
could modulate with great skill; but he had also
the power of quacking like an angry duck, and the
latter was his almost invariable way of speaking to
boys to inspire respect. His red shaggy eyebrows
were so prominent that he habitually used them as
arms and hands for the purpose of pointing out any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
object towards which he wished to direct attention.
The rest of his features were equally striking in
their way, and highly characteristic of the man.</p>

<p>Dr. Keate was not devoid of sense of humour.
On one occasion when he had set a certain form
an essay on “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Temere nil facias</i>,” one boy named
Rashleigh failed to send in any work at all. The
Doctor, who of all men was the last to be trifled
with in such matters, sent for the delinquent, and,
glowering with ferocity, demanded the meaning
of such conduct. The culprit, however, was quite
undismayed and replied, “Sir, you told me yourself
not to do it.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” retorted Keate in tones
of thunder.</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” replied the boy, “in setting the
theme you said, ‘Do nothing rashly,’ and I have
obeyed you.” This display of ready wit, it is said,
secured the offender’s pardon.</p>

<p>When Keate assumed the Headmastership the
whole public-school system had remained behind
the age, and many of the manners and customs of
barbarous times still continued at schools long
after home life and manners had become civilised.
There is no reason to suppose that Dr. Keate was
in any way of a brutal disposition or wanting in
natural affections. He had to deal with a very
difficult situation, and it is greatly to his credit
that he maintained the prestige and increased
the numbers of Eton in spite of almost insurmountable
difficulties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>When, for instance, it became clear to the boys
that the easy-going state of affairs which had prevailed
under Dr. Goodall had come to an end, the
school was thrown into a state of latent rebellion.
One of the first innovations imposed by Keate was
to impose an “absence” the evening after what
was then known as “long church.”</p>

<p>The first time this was put into force the whole
school booed the Headmaster as he opened his
mouth, and it took him two hours to get through
calling the “absence,” though various tutors did
all they could to help him detect the boys who
were the ringleaders of the disorder. After trying
to discover the principal culprits and failing, Keate
finally determined to punish the last remove of
the Upper Fifth and the whole of the Lower Fifth
(there was then no Middle Division), whom he
considered responsible for the outbreak, by making
them attend a five-o’clock “absence.” Some ninety
boys absented themselves, or rather hid behind
the trees in the playing fields where this “absence”
was called, and purposely did not answer their
names. The situation was grave, and at first it
seemed likely that all of these rebels would be
expelled; eventually, however, Keate determined
to be more lenient and merely announced that
he would “flog the lot.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">SWISHING WHOLESALE</div>

<p>When the first batch came up for punishment
in the library a scene of riot took place, and as the
first boy knelt down on the block a shower of eggs
smashed round Keate; in fact, after three victims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
had suffered, the Headmaster’s clothes had got into
such a state owing to the unsavoury missiles hurled
at him, that he had to go home and change. On
his return, however, he was seen to be accompanied
by a number of assistant masters, and owing to
their aid in keeping order he had finished swishing
the whole of the ninety boys by eight o’clock that
evening.</p>

<p>The masters must have had their work cut out
to subdue the insubordination of such turbulent
boys. Though the number of these boys was close
on 500&mdash;later, from 1821 to 1827, it varied between
528 and 612&mdash;at no time were there more than
nine assistants, including the Lower Master.
While some of the forms in the Lower School only
had twenty or thirty boys, certain divisions in the
Upper School were of quite unwieldy size. In
1820 Dr. Keate’s own division had swelled to 198.
He then relieved himself by creating the Middle
Division of the Fifth, but he continued to keep
about 100 boys under his own charge at the end of
Upper School, where much disorder prevailed.</p>

<p>All sorts of jokes and tricks were indulged in,
and about 1810 it became a regular practice during
the Winter Half to try and put out the candles in
the two great chandeliers. There had originally
been three of these, but according to tradition the
third had been broken in the great rebellion some
thirty years before. On one occasion a huge stone
that was shied at the chandelier went within an
inch of Keate’s head and cracked the panel behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
him. Having somehow got to know the culprit,
Keate let it be known that it was a boy at a certain
dame’s, at the same time declaring that the only
chance the boy had was to give himself up and
trust to his leniency; otherwise he would be expelled.
The boy was George Dallas, a straightforward
fellow. He immediately went to Keate,
confessed, and solemnly assured the Doctor that he
had never intended to hurt him. Keate said he
believed him, but of course Dallas must know that
the lightest punishment he deserved was a good
flogging, and that flogging he got.</p>

<p>A large part of the boys’ time seems to have
been spent devising ingenious forms of annoying
Keate, who sat enthroned in a spacious elevated
desk, enclosed on all sides, like a pew, with two
doors, one on each side. One fine morning he
entered Upper School, and, going to his desk, tried
to open one door, and found it was fastened. He
went round, grinning, growling, and snarling, to
the other side; the door there had been screwed
up too. The desk was up to the breast of a
tall man and as high as Keate’s head; nevertheless,
laying his hand on the top of it, he
lightly vaulted in, the feat being saluted with
loud cheers and a hearty laugh. This made
the Doctor more angry than ever. “I will
make some of you suffer,” he said, and he did;
for the next day, to the general astonishment, he
called up all the boys who had been concerned
in the screwing up and soundly flogged them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
The secret of this was that Cartland, Keate’s
servant, suspecting that mischief was afoot, secreting
himself between the ceiling and roof of Upper
School, had witnessed the whole screwing-up
process through the rose from which hung a
chandelier, and carefully noted down the names of
the boys concerned.</p>

<p>Another time a huge mastiff was put under
Keate’s seat, but the Doctor was fiercer than the
dog, which ran away, frightened at his angry gaze.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THIS ISN’T A GIRLS’ SCHOOL</div>

<p>One of the old school, Keate had no sympathy
with innovations. Though he himself is
said to have always carried an umbrella in sunshine
as well as rain, he could not bear to see a boy with
one. “Wet, sir? Don’t talk to me of weather,
sir,” he would say; “you must make the best of it.
This isn’t a girls’ school.” By way of paying their
Headmaster out for such a remark, a party of
boys once made an expedition to the neighbouring
village of Upton, took down a large board inscribed
in smart gilt letters “Seminary for Young
Ladies,” and fixed it up over the great west
entrance into the school-yard, where it met the
Doctor’s angry eyes in the morning.</p>

<p>In spite of his stern disposition and rough
ways Keate was highly sensitive as to ridicule,
and especially disliked attempts to caricature his
appearance.</p>

<p>When the informer in the celebrated case of
the Cato Street conspirators&mdash;an Italian image-man
by trade, and a very clever one&mdash;made his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
appearance at Eton one day with a tray full of
plaster busts of the well-known Doctor, cocked
hat and all, Keate was very much annoyed to find
that his likeness was selling like wildfire amongst
the boys. There seemed to be only one way of
preventing the wholesale popularisation of his
dumpy figure, so, buying up what was left of the
Italian’s stock, he had the figures taken to his
backyard and broken up.</p>

<p>One or two boys had the temerity to personate
Keate. Lord Douro, son of the Iron Duke, dressed
in an exact copy of the Doctor’s robes and hat,
actually painted the Headmaster’s door red one
night, to the amazement of a few persons who saw
him.</p>

<p>In some verse commemorating this feat, the
watchmen were supposed to be summoned before a
conclave of masters the next morning to describe
what they had seen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentthree">“We both last night
</div><div class="indentbase">Saw him&mdash;the Doctor&mdash;in his own cocked-hat,
</div><div class="indentbase">His bands, his breeches, and his bombasine,
</div><div class="indentbase">Paint his own door-post red.” Then great the wrath,
</div><div class="indentbase">And great the marvel of that conclave; all
</div><div class="indentbase">Turned their cold eyes on him, their dreaded chief,
</div><div class="indentbase">Convicted on such damning evidence
</div><div class="indentbase">Of this irreverend deed.
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Keate never discovered the culprit till years
after when, as a Canon of Windsor, he was entertaining
Lord Douro at dinner. The latter, speaking
of Eton days, alluded to the door-painting
incident, and was about to make a full confession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
when Keate became so red in the face that he
thought it wiser to desist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AMATEUR FLOGGING</div>

<p>Lord Abingdon was another Eton boy noted
for his mimicry of Keate; indeed, dressed up in
a cocked hat and gown made expressly for him,
his disguise was so perfect that he actually went
round one night and called “Absence” at the
different dames’ houses without being detected.
Years later, after a dinner-party at his home in
Oxfordshire, his Lordship would dress up as Keate,
and, birch in hand, enact a scene in the “library”
for the edification of visitors. On one of these
occasions he persuaded one of them to “go down”
on a block, made in exact imitation of that at Eton,
which stood in the room, whilst two others “held
him down,” and the story goes that the noble host
pitched into his guest with such hearty goodwill
that, when allowed to get up, the latter was so sore
in more ways than one that he called for his carriage
and drove off in a great rage.</p>

<p>Though boys mimicked and laughed at Keate
behind his back, very few had the courage to stand
up to him face to face. One of the few, however,
who did so was Charles Fox Townshend, the
founder of “Pop,” who, “staying out” on account
of indisposition, refused to write out and translate
the lessons of the day, in consequence of which he
was in due course summoned to the awful presence
of the redoubtable Headmaster. In the well-known
tones of thunder which made four generations
of Etonians tremble, Keate demanded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
meaning of such conduct. “Don’t speak so loud,
Dr. Keate,” replied Townshend, “or you will make
my head ache. If I had felt fit to write out and
translate the lesson I should have gone into school,
but I did not feel well enough, so I stayed out.”
The famous Headmaster, it is said, was so dumbfoundered
by the readiness of the delinquent’s reply
that he let him go without any punishment.</p>

<p>On the whole, Keate does not seem to have been
an ill-natured man, for, in spite of his occasional fits
of ferocity, he was held in considerable esteem by
a large number of the boys. They bore him no
ill-will for the floggings he had caused them to
undergo, and, when he left Eton in 1834, presented
him with a gift testifying their appreciation of his
merits. This consisted of a silver reproduction of
the Warwick Vase, on the pedestal of which was
inscribed&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN AMUSING DINNER</div>

<p>Keate was in Paris soon after Waterloo, and
there he met a number of old pupils to whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
had administered castigations. The latter determined
to give their former pedagogue a dinner,
which in due course took place at the Restaurant
Beauvilliers, then one of the best dining-places in
Paris, the hosts being Lord Sunderland, Lord
James Stuart, and other scions of the aristocracy.
The banquet was a most jovial one, and Keate did
full justice to its excellence, drinking every kind of
toast, and making a most suitable speech, which
appropriately ended with “Floreat Etona.” After
dinner a good deal of chaff began to fly around the
table, and the guest of the evening was told of
many Eton happenings which he had never heard
before. For the first time he learnt of how two
of his masters had secretly contrived to go up
to London every Saturday in order to dine with
Arnold and Kean at Drury Lane, surreptitious
suppers at the “Christopher” were described, whilst
tales of tandem expeditions, fights with bargees,
and poaching excursions in Windsor Park reached
his somewhat astonished ears. The old man,
however, took everything in excellent part, merely
remarking that all he had heard but inspired him
with regrets that he had not flogged the assembled
company as much as they appeared to have
deserved. On leaving, he thanked his hosts in
a few well-turned phrases, and, parting from them
on excellent terms, went home amidst loud cheers.</p>

<p>No doubt he owed a good part of the popularity
which, in spite of his sternness, he eventually obtained
to the attractions of Mrs. Keate, who was a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
fascinating woman. In the year 1814, during a
match with Epsom, the Eton champion, John
Harding, scored 74&mdash;an extraordinary number
in those days, when the bowling generally beat
the bat. It called forth a poem from a clever
Colleger (“Marshal” Stone), in which were the
following lines. The Doctor saw them and was
vastly amused:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentbase">No vulgar wood was the bat of might
</div><div class="indentbase">That swung in the grasp of Harding wight;
</div><div class="indentbase">No vulgar maker’s name it wore,

</div><div class="indentbase">And it drove the balls right lustily;
</div><div class="indentbase">Without a flaw, without a speck,
</div><div class="indentbase">Smoothe as fair Hebe’s ivory neck&mdash;
</div><div class="indentbase">It was withal so light, so neat,
</div><div class="indentbase">The Harding called it&mdash;Mrs. Keate.
</div></div></div></div>

<p>When the allied sovereigns were present at a
fête in the gardens at Frogmore in 1815, the King
of Prussia is said to have gone up and kissed
Mrs. Keate, making the excuse of her remarkable
likeness to his Queen.</p>

<p>All sorts of stories have been told of Keate’s
fondness for wielding the birch. “Remember,
boys,” he is once supposed to have said, “you
are to be pure in heart, or I’ll flog you till you
are.”</p>

<p>He certainly did castigate an enormous number
of Etonians, amongst them, it is said, half the
Ministers, Secretaries, Bishops, Generals, and
Dukes of the earlier portion of the nineteenth
century; but, nevertheless, the boys in his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
division were usually punished by having to write
out impositions, and were not flogged except for
some very flagrant offence, such as intoxication.</p>

<p>Keate, as Headmaster of Eton, it must be
remembered, was chief executioner, and had to
do justice when a boy was complained of by any
assistant master.</p>

<p>The school had drifted into very slack ways, and
Keate, who possessed a very intimate knowledge
of Eton, realised that leniency would merely make
matters worse. Consequently he rather favoured
drastic measures, and in spite of adverse criticism
his system had a good effect. It has often been
urged that it failed because the boys at times
openly defied his authority. In the earlier days
of his rule this was occasionally the case, and gross
insubordination prevailed, though it never reached
such a point as it had attained in the days of
Keate’s predecessors. On the other hand, when
the stern old Headmaster handed over the reins
of power to Dr. Hawtrey, the school had become
quite orderly and controlled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NAPOLEONIC METHODS</div>

<p>Though, as has already been said, not much
given to flogging boys under his immediate control,
he was a firm believer in the efficacy of the birch
for almost every kind of offence, and was quite
ready to be a ruthless executioner in order to
facilitate the work of his subordinates.</p>

<p>His methods were entirely Napoleonic, and
when flogging boys who had committed some
unusually heinous offence, by way of making an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
impression on their minds as well as their bodies,
he used to accompany his infliction of punishment
with a number of cutting remarks punctuated by
strokes of the birch: “A disgrace to your friends”
(swish, swish), “Ruin to your parents” (swish,
swish, swish, swish), “You’ll come to the gallows
at last!” and so forth.</p>

<p>Flogging at Eton was once described by the
<cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> as “an operation performed on
the naked back by the Headmaster himself, who is
always a gentleman, and sometimes a high dignitary
of the Church.”</p>

<p>The Eton boys of the past took their floggings
very lightly. One of them having, it is said, been
flogged by the Headmaster by mistake for another
boy, though he knew that he had done nothing to
deserve his castigation, made no attempt whatever
to escape it. When, however, the real culprit
was discovered an investigation took place, and the
flogged one’s tutor then asked, “Why did you not
explain to the Headmaster that you had never been
complained of?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” was the reply, “I have been complained
of so often that once more or less didn’t
seem to matter much; besides, I thought that very
likely some master I had forgotten about might
have complained of me after all.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Headmaster’s Room, showing Swishing Block and Birches.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Like many others, Fielding, a typical Englishman
of a long-past age, was in after life proud of
having been flogged. Alluding to Eton in his
introduction to the thirteenth book of <cite>Tom Jones</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
he says, “Thee in thy favourite fields, where the
limpid, gently rolling Thames washes thy Etonian
banks, in early youth I have worshipped. To thee,
at thy birchen altar, with true Spartan devotion, I
have sacrificed my blood.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">REFUSING TO GO DOWN</div>

<p>In later times, however, a certain number of
boys have shown an invincible dislike of being
birched, and some have actually preferred to
undergo expulsion rather than kneel at the block.
The 4th Marquis of Ailesbury (notorious for his
follies) when a boy at Eton, having been complained
of, ran away in order to avoid a punishment
to which he declared he would never submit.
This, I believe, happened twice, after which he was
at last obliged to confront the Lower Master, who
administered a certain number of strokes. On
rising from the block, however, the irrepressible
culprit made use of such language that his sojourn
at Eton was at once cut short. In most cases,
however, fear of expulsion has generally made those
summoned to the block submit. A peculiar case
was that of a boy high up in the school, and a well-known
swell at athletics, who, going up to Oxford
in order to matriculate, instead of returning to
Eton directly the examination was over, outstayed
his leave and remained for some days amusing himself
with a Christchurch friend. As a consequent
result, when he did return the voice of a praepostor
was heard inquiring “Is &mdash;&mdash; in this division? He
is to stay.” The culprit, who considered himself a
grown man, at first stoutly declared that nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
would induce him to undergo a flogging, and it
required a good deal of persuasion to make him
realise that continued resistance would entail his
going away from Eton without a leaving book;
that is to say, practical expulsion, which is liable
to injure a boy’s prospects in after life. Eventually,
concluding that it would be best to submit, he duly
paid the required visit to the library, where Dr.
Balston officiated in a most sympathetic but
efficient manner.</p>

<p>In rougher days, scapegraces used to make a
flogging the occasion for all sorts of jokes. One
boy, for instance, got a friend who had some knowledge
of art to paint a rough portrait of the Headmaster
on that portion of his body which has
always been associated with the punishment of
youth. When the Head was about to deliver his
blows he was at first considerably taken aback by
being confronted by his own likeness upon such an
unconventional background. However, he rose to
the occasion, and, with the aid of a couple of
birches, completely obliterated all trace of any
portrait.</p>

<p>In the case of big boys there is some humiliation
in being flogged. A certain captain of the boats,
who had indulged too freely in champagne, a very
tall and powerful young man, about to be flogged
by Dr. Hawtrey, begged hard that he should
receive his punishment in private, and thus escape
the degradation of being observed on the block by a
large crowd of boys looking through the open door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
The Headmaster, however, would not hear of this
for a moment, declaring that publicity was the
chief part of the punishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SABBATH CASTIGATION</div>

<p>When Election Saturday was in full swing, a
certain number of boys made a point of indulging
in insubordination, thinking that so close to the
end of the half they would escape punishment.
Some of the masters, however, made a point of
punishing irregularities at such a time with ruthless
determination, and never failed to complain of
any boy whom they found to be intoxicated on
Election Saturday, with the result that floggings
on the Sunday (the boys then went home on the
Monday) were not infrequent.</p>

<p>In order to castigate such offenders. Dr. Goodford
would be ready in his room on Sunday,
where he would sometimes attend at 10.30 at
night, in order to flog boys going by an early train
next day. Even those leaving Eton altogether
had to submit, for otherwise they would have been
ranked as being expelled. Mr. Brinsley Richards
tells of a boy, nearly six feet high, and with a
moustache, who debated in agony of mind whether
he would take a swishing on the night before leaving
the school. He had actually got a commission
in the cavalry; his uniforms were ordered, and he
was to join his regiment in ten days; but on
Election Saturday night he got uproariously drunk,
was seen by a strict master, and put in the bill.
He duly surrendered to his fate, received twelve
cuts with “two birches,” and the following day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
took leave of Dr. Goodford on the pleasantest
terms possible.</p>

<p>Dr. Goodford seems to have taken a genial
view of flogging; on the morning of one St.
Andrew’s Day he swished a Scotch boy who was
coming to breakfast with him, and greeted him
later on at that meal with a cheery “Here we are
again!”</p>

<p>An amusing story used to be told of a boy just
about to leave Eton who, having refused to be
flogged, on his arrival at home discovered, to his
horror, that his refusal to bow to constituted
authority would prevent him from being allowed
to enter the career upon which he had set his
heart. Hoping to put matters right, he at once
set out for Eton, only to find on his arrival there
that the Headmaster had gone to Switzerland.
The ingenious youth, determined to get flogged,
then somehow procured two birches and hurried
off to Geneva, only to find that the Head had gone
on to Lucerne. To that city he too followed, but,
missing the pedagogue whom he sought, again had
to continue his pursuit, which eventually ended in
the refectory of the Monastery of Mont St. Bernard,
where he eventually persuaded the Doctor to administer
the sought-for flogging amidst a circle of
edified monks. The ordeal over, the Headmaster
was presented with the leaving fee, which was then
customary, in return handing the relieved youth a
leaving book in the shape of a <cite>Guide</cite> to the Alps,
which happened to be the only volume procurable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A SWISHING TRADITION</div>

<p>During the writer’s school days at Eton, though
flogging was in full swing, the castigations administered
by Dr. Hornby&mdash;and he speaks from personal
experience&mdash;were not severe. On the other hand
the Lower Master, the Rev. J. L. Joynes, tempered
the severity of his floggings according to the
offence which they were intended to correct. On
one occasion the writer remembers him laying
with a will into a boy who is now a distinguished
officer. The latter, however, although he received
some thirty-two strokes, administered with two
birches (the first one after a time became useless
owing to the force with which it was used), never
flinched in the least, though this “real flogging”
must have occasioned considerable pain, very
different from the mild sensation produced by
the usual ones&mdash;often little more than a disagreeable
form. At that time the tradition still prevailed
that the wielder of the rod whilst “swishing” was
not allowed to lift his hand above his shoulder.
Though, as far as the writer can remember, this
rule was adhered to by the executioner, he has
since heard that the sole foundation for the idea
was a curious underhand motion of the right arm
peculiar to Dr. Hawtrey which his successors seem
to have copied.</p>

<p>From time to time more or less public protests
have been made against the use of the birch, which
has always been an object of detestation in the eyes
of sentimentalists and professional humanitarians.</p>

<p>In 1856 a long correspondence appeared in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
<cite>Times</cite> dealing with the question of flogging. This
arose out of the case of a boy named Morgan
Thomas, whose father upheld him in not submitting
to be flogged.</p>

<p>A report that in future no Upper boys will be
flogged, recently called forth some controversy in
the newspapers, most old Etonians being, it would
appear, of opinion that the abolition of the birch
and the substitution of other punishments, including,
I believe, caning, are to be deplored. The
inevitable sentimentalist, however, was of course
well to the front, declaring that “birching, or even
caning, is out of date, it being much better to
bring boys up to do the right thing and to avoid
doing the wrong thing from a sense of honour and
pledge.” Apparently this gentleman was under the
impression that such a method of education was a
new and entire innovation!</p>

<p>In future it appears that amongst Upper
boys, flogging is to be supplanted by something
resembling the painful process once known as a
“College hiding.” At the time when Oppidan
Fourth Form boys used to delight in jeering at
Tugs, a good many, being captured by Collegers,
were dragged off and given a number of cuts with
a cane&mdash;a far more painful ordeal, it was said, than
an ordinary swishing by the Headmaster.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ABDUCTING THE BLOCK</div>

<p>On the evening of the 12th May 1836 three
old Etonians&mdash;Lord Waterford, Lord Alford, and
Mr. J. H. Jesse, who had been entertaining some
boys to dinner at the Christopher after a boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
race against Westminster, being in particularly high
spirits, determined to have some fun before driving
back to town. Not being able to get into Upper
School (where the block was then kept) by the
door, Mr. Jesse and Lord Waterford, at considerable
risk, crept along the narrow stone ledge
over the colonnade, and, entering Upper School
by an open window, forced the lock of the door
from within, and carried their prize off in triumph,
in spite of an attempt to stop them on the part
of the College watchman. The trophy, I believe,
was never returned, and is still in existence at
Curraghmore.</p>

<p>Though the abduction of the block was considered
a capital joke, a more serious view was
taken of another exploit afterwards perpetrated
by Mr. Jesse. During Ascot week of the following
year he contrived to wrench the sceptre from the
hand of the statue of the founder in School
Yard and get away with it. This aroused a
very strong feeling of indignation amongst boys
as well as masters, and the emblem of sovereignty
was, in consequence, soon restored with an apology.
This is the only time that the bronze effigy of
Henry VI., erected by Provost Godolphin in the
early years of the eighteenth century, has ever been
molested.</p>

<p>The block in Lower School has also had its
adventures. In or about 1863 a King’s scholar,
Lewis by name, during some disturbance abstracted
it&mdash;according to tradition to save it from being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
destroyed during some disorder. Whatever may
have been the truth of the matter, he kept it, and
when, a short time later, he obtained a Postmastership
at Merton, took it away to Oxford with the
rest of his belongings. On his death this block
passed into the possession of Dr. Lewis, who lived
in Glamorganshire; and when this gentleman
died, Mr. F. T. Bircham, obtaining it from his
widow, handed it back to the Headmaster of Eton
on May 3, 1890.</p>

<p>The venerable, though somewhat gruesome relic
in question is of some historical interest, for on
it are carved a number of names, amongst them
Milman, Lonsdale, Routh, Wellesley, and H.
Hall (1773). It is to be hoped that, should Lower
boys ever cease to need the discipline of the birch,
this relic of sterner days will be kept in Lower
School, with the old-world appearance of which it
so well accords.</p>

<p>The present block, the one used in the library,
was, I believe, abducted some three or four years
ago, two boys having carried out the extraordinary
feat of climbing into Upper School through a
window and smuggling out the awesome relic
of torture, which they eventually sent to the
authorities of the British Museum, who returned
it to the authorities of the school.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE OFFICIAL BIRCHMAKER</div>

<p>An important functionary in connection with
Eton castigations has always been the Headmaster’s
servant, rod-making being one of his traditional
functions. Under Keate the office was held by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Cartland, opprobriously nicknamed “Sly” by
Collegers, who abhorred him. In Dr. Hawtrey’s
day came Finmore, who, after the former’s death,
continued in office as servant to Dr. Goodford. Part
of the duties of the office lay in seeing that there
were always at least half a dozen new rods in the
cupboard of the “library,” Dr. Goodford being apt
to get very angry if an execution had to be adjourned
for want of birches. A dozen new rods
were supposed to be at hand in the cupboard every
morning, for there was no calculating the number
of floggings that might be inflicted in a day.
Finmore used to make the rods at his own house,
with the help of his wife, and brought them to
the library quietly after Lock Up, or in the
morning before early school. Sometimes, however,
when the supply of rods ran short Finmore had
to bring in fresh birches in the middle of the
day, which, for several reasons, was a somewhat
hazardous task.</p>

<p>One afternoon, after three o’clock school, when
there were only three birches available, six boys
were up to be flogged. The Head flogged three
of the culprits and adjourned the others till six
o’clock, at the same time ordering the Sixth Form
praepostor to be sure and tell Finmore that the
cupboard must be replenished before six. Some
Lower boys, however, getting wind of this, and hearing
that Finmore was bound to come to the library
between four and five, lay in wait for him, and in
due course espied him hovering near the top of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Keate’s Lane, empty-handed, but walking suspiciously
near to a grocer’s cart making its
way towards Weston’s Yard. Suddenly a shout
was raised, and the crowd of boys, scampering off,
stopped the cart just as it was turning into the
yard, surrounded it yelling, and extracted from it
six new birches wrapped in a cloth. Finmore,
breathless and almost choking with emotion, vainly
tried to save his rods. Half a dozen boys,
however, soon ran off with one apiece, the unfortunate
official being left to bewail his evil fate.
In Dr. Hornby’s day the custodian of the birches
was White, a spruce, neatly-dressed figure whom
many old Etonians will still remember.</p>

<p>He it was who, in consideration of a fee of a
guinea, saw that the names of boys leaving Eton
were cut in Upper School. For a consideration
he would also supply birches tied up with blue
ribbon to any one desirous of carrying away such
grim mementoes.</p>

<p>Whilst the block, for Lower boys at least,
remains one of the features of Eton, fighting,
once a characteristic institution of the school, has
long disappeared, having seemingly fallen out of
favour in the late fifties of the last century.</p>

<p>In the period preceding Waterloo the combats
were fierce and frequent; there was one nearly
every day, and so determined were the Etonians
of that era that there is a case on record of two
boys rising at six in the morning to begin the
conflict, and sparring away for three hours!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">“SIXPENNY CORNER”</div>

<p>Whilst the Oppidans, according to immemorial
custom, settled their differences in “Sixpenny
Corner,” the Collegers fought their battles in Long
Chamber. An unwritten code decreed that when
a King’s scholar wished to fight he must ask permission
of the Captain of the school to be allowed
to do so after Lock Up, and this, as may be
imagined, was never refused. About nine o’clock
a fairly spacious ring was formed just below the
second fireplace, boys standing on bedsteads placed
around, holding candles, which enabled the combatants
to see one another. It would appear that
in the old fighting days the Collegers fought
fewer battles than the Oppidans,&mdash;the fights of
the former were usually short and sharp, the boys
being so well acquainted with each other’s strength
and powers, that after a round or two the fight was
discontinued and the quarrel made up.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned encounters in “Sixpenny
Corner,” which seem to have been conducted in a
more or less formal style, were, of course, most
frequent in the days when the Prize Ring occupied
a prominent place amongst sports patronised by
men of fashion.</p>

<p>Young Corinthians who had only just left
school no doubt indoctrinated friends still at
Eton with enthusiasm for the knights of the fist,
and caused them to regard pugilism as a science
worthy of attention.</p>

<p>A curious piece of etiquette in connection with
fighting was, that if a Lower boy wanted to fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
one in the Upper School, he could do so only
after having obtained leave from the Captain of
the school.</p>

<p>At one time Eton battles were fought with
hats on, which caused the Westminster boys to
declare that, owing to the damage inflicted upon
knuckles by the hat brims, most Etonian encounters
were not of a serious kind.</p>

<p>The Sixth Form and Upper boys were expected
to see that fair-play was enforced, and that when
one combatant was clearly overmatched and plainly
worsted, a reconciliation took place. Both were
made to shake hands, and having vented their ill-feeling
in a manly and honourable way, they were
afterwards often found to be the best of friends.</p>

<p>A great battle at the beginning of the nineteenth
century was the fight between Calthorp
and Forster.</p>

<p>“Sixpenny Corner,” at the angle where the wall
game now takes place, was the traditional scene
of battle, and here the great Duke of Wellington,
as little Arthur Wellesley, fought Bobus Smith,
brother of Sydney Smith, the fight, according to
all accounts, ending in a draw.</p>

<p>A redoubtable pugilist was Stratford de Redcliffe,
who emerged victor from many a tough contest.
Less successful was Shelley, who is said to have
received a severe thrashing from little Sir Thomas
Styles. During another fight the youthful poet
attracted a good deal of attention by refusing
to rest on the knee of his second, preferring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to stride round the ring quoting Homer! No
wonder the boys used to call him “mad Shelley”!
It must be remembered, however, that he was
a constant butt for a large portion of the
school. “My belief,” said Dr. Hawtrey, “is that
what Shelley had to endure at Eton made him a
perfect devil.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THRASHING A LIFEGUARDSMAN</div>

<p>In the early days of the nineteenth century a
gigantic boy named Wyvill became celebrated for
his fistic powers. He once gave a Lifeguardsman a
severe thrashing in Windsor, and the soldier was
so much upset that he went to the Headmaster,
Dr. Goodall, to complain of his mauling. The
latter, who hated to have to take notice of any
Eton escapade, said, “My good fellow, how can
you expect me to know what boy it was?”
“Boy!” he answered with a country accent; “he
is the biggest mun in the tuttens,” or two towns.
And so Wyvill ever after went by the name of
“the biggest mun in the tuttens.”</p>

<p>When a challenge had been given and accepted,
the details of the forthcoming fight were arranged
by friends, after which the combatants just walked
into the playing fields with their seconds, stripped
off their jackets, and went to work, the boys forming
a ring, no other formalities being observed&mdash;hardly
even a sponge or a watch. When a minute
was supposed to have elapsed, one got up from his
second’s knee and said, “Come on.” A little hot
blood flowed, and as soon as either felt he had
enough he had only to say so. Drawn battles were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
not common or popular, boys preferring to have
matters brought to an issue. There was the most
perfect fair-play, and if things were carried at all
too far, interference was pretty sure to be at hand,
though not otherwise. When, during a fight,
Keate just showed himself at the corner of the
playing fields, the hint was immediately taken.</p>

<p>Fights between Lower boys, it should be added,
were deemed of small account, but a battle
between two well-known Uppers always attracted
a large crowd.</p>

<p>The most tragic fight which ever took place at
Eton was a fierce battle between a small boy named
Ashley Cooper and a big one named Wood (afterwards
Sir A. Wood). For three hours the unequal
combat was carried on, till, in the last round
before Lock Up, the former fell senseless and had
to be carried to his tutor’s house, where, half an
hour later, he expired. His death, however, seems
to have been caused by a quantity of brandy given
him by his elder brother, rather than by the effects
of the fight. Also, had medical attendance been procured,
Cooper’s life would probably have been saved.
After, however, he had been carried senseless to
his house, every effort was made to conceal the
state in which he was in, gloves being placed upon
his hands so that their dreadful condition might
not be visible. The boy died the same night.</p>

<p>The sequel of the encounter was a trial at
Aylesbury, where, on March 9, 1825, Charles Alexander
Wood, seventeen years old, was charged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
before Mr. Justice Gazelee with the manslaughter
of the Hon. Francis Ashley Cooper, after a quarrel
in the Eton playing fields. The fight, it was
proved, had been conducted in the strictest accordance
with the rules of the Prize Ring, which at
that time still flourished. No less than sixty
rounds were shown to have been fought with the
fiercest determination&mdash;the time occupied, two
hours. Cooper, who was two years younger
than his antagonist, had been given nearly
a pint of brandy to enable him to continue
the struggle against a more powerful opponent.
Wood was, of course, acquitted; besides which,
Cooper’s brother entirely exonerated him, taking
all the blame on himself for having administered
the brandy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN ILLEGIBLE INSCRIPTION</div>

<p>This battle&mdash;the most serious schoolboy fight
which ever took place&mdash;probably had some effect
in decreasing the popularity of fistic encounters.
It certainly created a great sensation, being, according
to some, commemorated by an inscription
(now illegible) upon the white stone let into the
wall at Sixpenny Corner. The late Mr. Brownlow
North, Lord Kintore tells me, declared that
he had been a second at the fight, and remembered
the insertion of the stone as a memorial.</p>

<p>The Gasworks eventually superseded “Sixpenny”
as a fistic arena, though the time-honoured
phrase, “Will you fight me in ‘Sixpenny’?” still
remained the recognised form of challenge.</p>

<p>In 1858 fighting was already beginning to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
out of fashion. In 1865, while the Public Schools
Commissioners were sitting, they examined a
Lower boy touching fights, and asked him if he
had any theory to explain why regular stand-up
fights had become so rare? The boy answered,
“Oh! I suppose it’s because the fellows funk
each other.”</p>

<p>The real reason of the disappearance of fighting
was that it came to be thought bad form, and
consequently no longer received any patronage
from boys who were the swells of the school.
Once it began to be considered “scuggish,” the fate
of Eton pugilism was sealed, and though informal
encounters occasionally occur&mdash;there was a determined
battle near the railway arches in 1893&mdash;within
the last forty years fighting has become
a thing of the past.</p>

<h2>IV<br />
“CADS,” AND THE “CHRISTOPHER”</h2>


<p>Though a century or so ago fights and floggings
were ordinary incidents of school life, a large
number of boys contrived to make time pass
very pleasantly indeed. At that time the sporting
Etonian was quite a recognised type.</p>

<p>The following sketch, from the <cite>Sporting
Magazine</cite>, of Etonian ways in 1799, whilst, of
course, a somewhat exaggerated caricature, was
evidently based upon a very solid substratum of
truth:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Elaborate hoaxes were common at the commencement
of the nineteenth century. A young
Etonian acquired a good deal of notoriety by
sending the town-crier, whom he had fee’d for the
purpose, to announce a general illumination in
honour of the battle of Vittoria. It created quite
a sensation in both Windsor and Eton; and
although no one knew from whence the orders
came, G. R.’s and coloured lamps in abundance were
displayed in the windows of many of the houses.
A meeting of the magistrates was hastily summoned,
and the hoax was discovered. The writing gave
a clue to the culprit, who in due course underwent
the punishment usual in such cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">SPORTING BOYS</div>

<p>License which would be inconceivable at the
present day prevailed&mdash;bull-baiting on Batchelor’s
Acre and cock-fighting in Bedford’s Yard being
quite ordinary amusements. Small wonder that at
one time strong complaint was made as to the
habits of the school. Ascot Races were regularly
attended by many of the older boys. Hunting
and tandem-driving were not uncommon. Henry
Matthews, author of the <cite>Diary of an Invalid</cite>, a
very clever and eccentric boy, drove a tandem
right through Eton and Windsor; a later rival,
however, of Keate’s day, when James Clegg of
Windsor provided sporting boys with horses and
traps, drove one through the school-yard. Billiards
continued to be very popular, not only with the
boys but with their Masters, who claimed “first
turn” at the tables.</p>

<p>Copying the London bucks, Upper boys would
sally out on dark nights and wrench bell-pulls and
knockers from the dames’ houses, or make hay in
the poultry-yard of old Pocock, the farmer at the
corner of “Cut-throat” Lane, as Datchet Lane
was then sometimes called.</p>

<p>Poaching expeditions in Windsor Park were
quite common. On one occasion young Lord
Baltimore and a companion, when out after game,
were pursued by a Master. The young Peer,
however, escaped, but eventually gave himself
up in order to save his friend (who had refused to
divulge his associate’s name) from expulsion.</p>

<p>Guns could then be hired for the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
shooting swallows and swifts on the Brocas bank,
where a number of sporting “cads,” then known as
“Private Tutors,” assisted in all sorts of sprees,
providing dogs, fishing-tackle, badgers, ferrets, rats,
fighting dogs, horses, and even, it is said, bulls for
baiting.</p>

<p>Eighty or ninety years ago a dozen or more of
such men were constantly to be seen loitering in
front of the College every morning, making their
arrangements with their pupils, the Oppidans, for
a day’s sport, to commence the moment school was
over. At one time they used actually to occupy
a seat on the low wall in front of the College, but
Dr. Keate interfered to expel the assemblage;
nevertheless, they continued to carry on their intercourse
with the boys, and walked about watching
their opportunity for communication.</p>

<p>A number supplied cats for hunts upon the
Brocas, while a number organised duck hunts, a
duck being put into the river and hunted with
considerable brutality. A few, however, escaped
by diving and tiring the dogs out.</p>

<p>Some of these men were strange characters,
who showed great recklessness when times were
bad, and would be ready to let boys have a shot
at them at a distance of seventy-five yards or so,
three shillings a shot being the accepted price.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“PICKY POWELL”</div>

<p>Others would jump from the middle of Windsor
Bridge for a consideration. The stake-holder on
such occasions was usually Jem Powell, known as
“Picky” Powell, who about 1824 was celebrated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Eton for his “quart of sovereigns,” it being his
invariable practice when elated&mdash;for Jem, needless
to say, was no teetotaller&mdash;to march up and down
in front of his house with a silver-gilt tankard
filled with his savings, all in gold.</p>

<p>This Picky Powell would appear to be identical
with the individual who, years later, enjoyed a
considerable reputation as having been professional
bowler to the school. During the annual matches
with Harrow at Lord’s, Picky usually made a
point of having an informal sparring match with a
well-known Harrow “cad,” Billy Warner by name,
who, like his bigger antagonist, was supposed to
have been a notable cricketer in his youth. A
favourite taunt of Picky’s which usually inaugurated
hostilities was, “All the good I sees in
‘Arrow’ is that you can see Eton from it if ye go
up into the churchyard.”</p>

<p>The last appearance of Powell at Lord’s appears
to have been in 1858, when, as usual, he croaked
defiance at his hereditary foe. On this occasion,
however, no sparring was permitted, but Picky
reaped a rich harvest of silver, bestowed upon him
by old Etonians.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Jack Hall, Fisherman of Eton.<br />
<em>Print lent by G. Culliford, Esq.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>A well-known character of the past on the
Brocas was Jack Hall, nicknamed “Foxy Hall,”
by all accounts the most worthy of Eton “cads,”
and celebrated as an expert angler. His portrait,
taken from an old print, is here reproduced.
Others were Joe Cannon, Fish, “Shampo Carter”
(who taught swimming in 1824 with the Headmaster’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
permission), Jack Garraway, and the
Anti-Catholic Jim Miller, the patriarch of “cads,”
who signed a petition against Catholic Emancipation
“upon principle.” “For,” he said, “when
the d&mdash;&mdash;d rogues burnt Cranmer and Ridley, they
never paid for the fagots&mdash;unprincipled varmints!”
A great deal of license was accorded to these wall
loungers, most of whom were ready to abet the
boys in every kind of mischief.</p>

<p>One of the most noted sporting “cads” was
old Jimmy Flowers, whose speciality was badger-baiting
on the Brocas, his stock-in-trade consisting
of a badger in a sack and an old tub with one
end knocked out. Dogs used to be put into the
tub to fetch the badger out, the charge being
sixpence, unless the fight with the badger lasted
very long, when Old Jimmy used to exact a further
fee. When the fun, if it can be called fun, had
lasted long enough, the badger, whose opinion of
the proceedings it would have been interesting to
have heard, was replaced in the sack, and with a
cheery “Good day, gentlemen, your dogs have had
good sport,” Jimmy would walk away.</p>

<p>Another well-known character in the beginning
of the nineteenth century was Old Matty Groves,
who was much teased by the boys on account of his
rooted antipathy to clergymen, whom he used to
denounce as the “black slugs” of the country. He
it was who led the procession which every seven
years went round to beat the Eton boundary, and
nailed up a cross of old iron hoops on a venerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
willow near the grounds of Black Potts, where in
after years Dr. Hornby had a retreat. Old Matty
was very unconventional in his ways, and had been
known in flood-time, when the stream was running
strong, to plunge into it in his clothes at Barnes
Pool Bridge and swim across to his cottage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FLOODS</div>

<p>Floods have always been liable to occur at
Eton, though, for the most part, they have
generally subsided before becoming serious. In
1809, however, there was a tremendous one,
which carried away six of the central arches of
the old “Fifteen Arch” Bridge on the Slough
Road that spans the stream which feeds Fellows’
Pond. For five days the only communication
with some of the boarding-houses was by boats and
carts, and the school had practically a week’s
holiday. The boys lay in bed till a late hour,
and when they got up it was to play cards and get
into other mischief. Driving down Eton Street in
carts, with the risk of getting spilt into the water,
was one of their favourite amusements.</p>

<p>Two subsequent floods have been almost, if not
quite, as serious&mdash;one in 1852, the year that the
Duke of Wellington died, and one in 1894, when
all the boys had to be sent home. Many of the
Masters, however, remained behind, and spent their
time in rescuing people in the surrounding country
and supplying them with food.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPANKIE</div>

<p>Though in 1829, owing to the adoption of stern
measures, the “Private Tutors” under whose
auspices many a boy had shot his first moor-hen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and laid his first eel-pot were expelled from the
College precincts, the “sock cads” continued to
haunt the “wall” for many years later. The
most celebrated of these, of course, was the
famous Spankie, who flourished about half a
century ago. Spankie never failed to appear in
the playing fields during summer, whilst in winter
he was more or less of a fixture at the wall.
Of him was written, one summer’s day when the
cricket was getting slow in Upper Club, the line,
“Totaque tartiferis Spancheia fervet ahenis.” A
ridiculous and unfounded school tradition declared
that he was a son of a General le Marchant, and
he was often playfully apostrophised by that name.</p>

<p>The principal characteristics of this worthy,
besides a rubicund countenance, a long blue frock
coat, and an old top hat (invariably worn on one
side of his head), were extreme oiliness of manner,
combined with an unlimited amount of cheek.
His wares, chiefly tartlets of all sorts, were contained
in a sort of huge tin can supported on legs.
At the proper season he also sold pots of flowers.</p>

<p>Spankie was imbued with a tremendous veneration
for the aristocracy, and prided himself upon
his acquaintance with the history of every noble
family in England. Rumour, indeed, declared that
most of his time out of sock-selling hours was
devoted to studying the <cite>Peerage</cite> and the <cite>Landed
Gentry</cite>, both of which works he was supposed
to know pretty well by heart. This, no doubt,
was a schoolboy exaggeration, but certain it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
that Spankie had a curious and not inaccurate
knowledge of the noble houses whose youthful
scions furnished him with a comfortable income. It
was a way of his to address the sons of distinguished
people by their fathers’ names, whilst, it should
be added, often fleecing them in a merciless
manner, for, sad to tell, his methods were not above
suspicion. A favourite trick was carefully to array
a few very fine strawberries or cherries at the top
of a pottle after filling up the lower portion with
very inferior fruit; as, however, he made a practice
of giving liberal tick, little was ever said about this.
He made quite a comfortable fortune out of the
Eton boys, as was realised when it became known
that he had contributed no less than £50 to the
fund for building a new parish church in the High
Street.</p>

<p>By the lower members of the school Spankie
was looked up to as a perfect oracle, for he seemed
to know everything, could predict who would be
members of the Eleven or Eight, and tell the name
and history of the latest comer, stringing on to it,
if necessary, a list of all his relations, with their
various achievements. One of this celebrated sock
cad’s chief peculiarities was that he could scarcely
utter three consecutive words without a “sir” coming
at the end of them; and it was marvellous how
he could change them as easily as he did into “my
lord” when any of the young aristocracy came up
to him.</p>

<p>In addition to entertaining an unlimited respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
for the British aristocracy, Spankie nurtured a
deep contempt for trade, as the small sons of rich
manufacturers, especially when they had failed to
meet their liabilities, frequently had reason to
know. “Good morning, sar,” Spankie would say
to a scion of some house not unconnected with
“cotton,” who might be rather backward in settling
his debts. “Glad to see you back, sar. Bought
some pocket-handkerchiefs at your establishment
in the vacation, sar; cheap enough, only six
shillings a dozen; but I don’t find them wash
well, sar.”</p>

<p>According to some, Spankie made quite a
comfortable little sum by supplying the names of
visitors to Eton to the London papers, whilst
rumour also declared that on occasion the College
authorities employed him to trace and recapture
runaways.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOCK CADS</div>

<p>One of Spankie’s best-known predecessors was a
sock cad named Charley Pass, who was to be seen
daily stationed at the wall near the gateway with a
curious tin apparatus containing pies, kept hot by a
charcoal brazier. He had a peculiar cry, somewhat
resembling that of the long obsolete pieman. “Ham
and Veal; Mutton Eel,” he would call out as the
boys were emerging from school. Young Collegers
who knew his ways would drive him to fury by
shouting “and dog&mdash;that’s what I want.” Trotman
with his barrow was also a familiar figure in
the “forties.”</p>

<p>Another sock cad who had some pretensions to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
being a rival to Spankie was a hook-nosed little man
known as Levi, the Jew. Spankie and he constantly
indulged in verbal sparring, in which the
Hebrew, who was a man of few words, as a rule
got much the worst of it. On one occasion this
so infuriated Levi that a battle royal ensued.
Goaded to frenzy by some taunt of Spankie’s, Levi
challenged him to come on, and an animated tussle
ensued, speedily ended only by the appearance of
one of the Masters, who, separating the combatants,
thoroughly frightened both by declaring that he
had a good mind to see that the two of them
should be prevented from frequenting the neighbourhood
of the wall. The idea of this thoroughly
cowed even the irrepressible Spankie, and henceforth
Levi and he lived at peace.</p>

<p>A less assertive character than either of the two
worthies mentioned above was old Brion or Bryant,
a white-headed sock cad whose invariable costume
was a grey coat. According to current report
he had no less than twenty-one children. His
speciality lay in purveying small glasses of cherry
jam dashed with cream at fourpence, which must
have yielded him a good profit.</p>

<p>Bryant outdid the other sock cads in owning a
huge barrow, which every day was wheeled to the
wall. A portly, good-natured man, he was not as
astute as Spankie, and consequently was frequently
imposed upon by his young customers. Sometimes,
however, he showed a keen aptitude for business.
When, for instance, a little boy complained that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
had given him but a small pennyworth of preserve
in his jam-bun, he would evince the amiability of
his intentions by saying, “I was afraid it might
disagree with you, sir.”</p>

<p>Another well-known character in the sixties of
the last century was an old lady known as “Missis,”
who sat by the entrance to the school-yard selling
apples, nuts, bullfinches, and dormice.</p>

<p>During more recent years there have been no
sock cads of such marked individuality as those
mentioned above, nor do they enjoy the privileges
which were accorded to their predecessors of a
more easy-going age, their appearance at the wall
being discouraged. Some, however, still ply their
trade in the playing fields and at the bathing-places.
The most original of the modern school
was “Hoppie.” Every portion of this worthy’s
costume, according to his own account, had
belonged to some prominent old Etonian. During
the summer half he was a constant frequenter of
“Upper Hope,” where perhaps he still parades
“the Duke of Wellington’s coat” and “Lord
Roberts’ trousers” as of yore.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago there were several individuals
known as “Jobey”&mdash;a name taken from almost
the last of the old Eton characters, “Jobey
Joel,” who died not very long ago. He remembered
the school when far more latitude was
allowed the boys, and had many a queer tale to
tell of that vanished institution, the Christopher,
now but a fading memory in the minds of a few.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CHRISTOPHER</div>

<p>The ancient hostelry in question would seem to
have flourished as long ago as the sixteenth century.
The mention of a certain Nicholas Williams lodging
“ad signum Christoferi” occurs in the Eton Audit
Book for 1523. The old inn served as a refuge to
the “ever memorable” Eton Fellow, John Hales,
who for his unwavering allegiance to the King was
deprived of his fellowship.</p>

<p>In later days the Christopher became a great
social centre of local life. All the coaches stopped
at its door, and before Dr. Hawtrey abolished
the Eton Market there was a weekly ordinary for
farmers, and occasionally a hunt dinner, with noise
enough to have driven the Muses back to Greece.
Its rooms were in great request with parents come
down to see their promising or unpromising
offspring, whilst old Etonians revisiting Eton
made the old place their headquarters as a matter
of course.</p>

<p>“Lord! how great I used to think anybody just
landed at the Christopher!” wrote Horace Walpole
when he returned to his old school in 1746. The
place recalled many memories of boyhood to his
mind, and he declared that he felt “just like Noah,
with all sorts of queer feels about him.”</p>

<p>Horace Walpole had passed some happy days
at Eton, where one of his greatest friends was the
studious and quiet Gray, who read Virgil for amusement
out of school. The writer of the famous
letters had a great affection for Eton, and Cambridge,
as he said, seemed a wilderness to him as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
compared with the “dear scene” he had left. In
after life the recollection of his school-days was
ever keen. When, for instance, he first saw a
balloon he declared that he was at once reminded
of an Eton football. Though fond of reading,
like many other Eton boys, the writer of the
famous letters showed little enthusiasm for the
school work.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I remember,” says he, “when I was at Eton, and Mr.
Bland had set me on an extraordinary task, I used sometimes
to pique myself upon not getting it, because it was not
immediately my school business. What! learn more than I
was absolutely forced to learn! I felt the weight of learning
that, for I was a blockhead, and pushed above my parts.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Spending much of his time in the playing fields
musing, he retained the recollection all his life.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“No old maid’s gown,” said he, “though it had been
tormented into all the fashions from King James to King
George, ever underwent so many transformations as these
poor plains have in my idea. At first I was contented with
tending a visionary flock and sighing some pastoral name to
the echo of the cascade under the bridge. As I got further
into Virgil and Clelia, I found myself transported from
Arcadia to the garden of Italy; and saw Windsor Castle in
no other view than the Capitoli immobile saxum.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In Horace Walpole’s day Kendall, himself an
old Etonian, presided over the Christopher. Later
came Garraway and Jack Knight.</p>

<p>The rattling of coach wheels over the cobblestones
outside the old inn was a never-failing
source of excitement and interest to the boys.
Most of them knew the drivers, whom they delighted
to hail with volleys of chaff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">STAGE COACHMEN</div>

<p>A famous Eton stage coachman was Jack
Bowes of the “Original,” which started from the
Bolt in Tun, Fleet Street, and called at Hatchett’s in
Piccadilly. Often on his arrival at the Christopher,
Bowes would be welcomed with a brisk fusillade
fired by boys from pea-shooters. He had been a
soldier and seen a good deal of service, and was a
most popular character with all sorts of people, and
especially with the relatives and fathers of Eton
boys; for, like Moody, another Eton coachman,
Bowes knew all that there was to be known about
the College and its ways. He was a kindly man,
and reassured many a small boy fresh from home
and nervous as to the ordeal awaiting him when
he reached the great public school. One idea
which not a few new boys had firmly implanted
upon their minds was that by way of initiation
into the privilege of becoming an Etonian they
would be pitched off Windsor Bridge and made to
struggle for their life. There was, of course, not
the slightest foundation for such an idea, which no
doubt arose because in former days it was no very
uncommon thing for Etonians, anxious to show
their powers as swimmers, to take a header from
the Bridge into the Thames beneath. Many
indeed were experts at such feats.</p>

<p>Less kindly than Bowes were some of the
hangers-on who gained a livelihood by lounging
about the White Horse Cellar in Piccadilly, which
was always a great rendezvous for all sorts of queer
characters, itinerant orange-vendors and others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
who flocked round the coaches hoping to make a
more or less honest penny. Amongst these was
one well-known individual who gained a livelihood
by doing odd jobs in the way of carrying parcels
and helping with luggage. He was especially
active on days when the Eton boys were returning
to school, and as he took some little fellow’s
trunk to hoist it on to the coach would cheerfully
impart the information that “he had never seen
such a fine load of birch as had gone down the day
before.”</p>

<p>“Bishop”&mdash;a particular kind of punch&mdash;and
Bulstrode ale were the two beverages for which
the Christopher was famous. Garraway brought
the latter into fashion, and a huge amount of it was
drunk, and though Garraway had only purchased
a small stock of this famous old ale at the sale at
Bulstrode, by some miraculous process it continued
to be served out in plentiful quantities ever after.
This became a standing joke against mine host of
the Christopher, who afterwards made a speciality
of an excellent tap, which he called the Queen’s,
from some he had purchased at Windsor. This
was sold in small quarts, at a shilling per jug.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE OPPIDANS’ CLUB</div>

<p>The old place was often quite full of undergraduates,
young officers, and bucks come down to
take a look at the school they had so recently left,
and some of these young men, especially those
from Oxford (where formerly so many Etonians
went on account of its being the headquarters of
classical learning) formed what was known as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
“Oppidans’ Club.” The main object of this convivial
association, which met in one of the cellars,
next to consuming large quantities of port, was to
sally out after nightfall and abduct the shops’
signs&mdash;barbers’ poles and other insignia of trade&mdash;from
the houses in the High Street, afterwards
bearing them back to the Christopher in triumph.
The tradesmen bore these eccentricities with considerable
fortitude, for in the end they were pretty
sure not to suffer.</p>

<p>Representations to the masters and authorities
were scarcely necessary to redress such whimsical
grievances, the injured parties being well aware
that they would receive due compensation. The
next day the spoils and trophies were arranged in
due form in the cellar at the old inn, which became
well known by the name of “Oppidan’s Museum.”
Here the merry wags were to be found in council,
holding a court of claims, to which all the shopkeepers
who had suffered any loss were successively
summoned; and after pointing out from among
the motley collection the article they claimed, and
the price it originally cost, they were handsomely
remunerated or the sign replaced. The good
people of Eton generally chose the former, as it
not only enabled them to sport a new sign, but to
put a little profit upon the cost price of the old
one. The trophies thus acquired were then packed
up in hampers and despatched to Oxford, where
they were on similar occasions not infrequently
displayed or hung up in lieu of some well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
sign, such as the Mitre, etc., which had been
removed during the night.</p>

<p>Some Collegers once played a joke of this sort
on Dr. Keate. A Windsor hatter, Jones by name,
had outside his shop an immense tin three-cornered
cocked hat as a sign, the exact counterpart, except
much larger, of the one Keate wore. This was
stolen one winter’s evening by a detachment of
Collegers; they managed to send it to London,
and thence, carefully packed, it was forwarded to
Keate. Meanwhile, a letter was sent to Jones
saying that the writer could give him some inkling
of who was the thief, for that Dr. Keate had long
been observed to eye this magnificent cocked hat
with longing envy, and there was no doubt if a
search warrant was procured, it would be found in
the house of the Headmaster.</p>

<p>The cellar in which met the so-called “Oppidans’
Club” was known as “the Estaminet.” The usual
fare here was bread and cheese, beer and porter,
and in its general features it seems to have been
the precursor of the present Tap. Lower boys
had no share in its amenities. On occasion, however,
stronger potations were indulged in, and of
course this was more especially the case when old
Etonians from the Universities were paying a visit
to their old school.</p>

<em>From a coloured print in the possession of the Rt. Honble. Lewis Harcourt, M.P.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>No doubt, these visitors had rather a demoralising
effect upon the boys who stood by in admiration,
envying the bucks who lounged over the
rails of the gallery and indulged in chaff with those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
below, whilst they ogled any pretty girl who might
chance to meet their roving glance, or chaffed any
mischievous Etonians who hung about the old
yard, occasionally pulling the bungs out of the
casks which were ranged there.</p>

<p>In the old Christopher the assistant masters at
one time had a room reserved for them in which
they were wont to meet, whilst regular convivial
assemblies were sometimes organised there by
Eton boys, one of the chief being on St. Andrew’s
Day, when Colleger had met Oppidan at the wall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A RAID</div>

<p>In its last years, when the famous hostelry
began to be regarded as a great moral danger by
the authorities, they began to make determined
efforts to prevent boys from being within its doors,
and one St. Andrew’s Day a raid was suddenly
made. Just as the revelry had reached its height,
Smut, otherwise known as Beelzebub, the head
waiter, announced the appearance of a party of
masters. Great confusion ensued, and as an
ominous creaking of boots was heard on the staircase,
the landlord’s daughter turned off the gas,
and all was left in darkness. A stentorian voice
was heard crying, “I require the landlord of this
house to provide me with a light.” Meanwhile, one
of the masters groped his way to the door of the
banqueting-room and held it so that no one could
pass. One of the raiding party, a master named
Goodford, who afterwards became “Head,” greatly
distinguished himself by embracing Smut, whom
in the darkness he mistook for a boy trying to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
his escape. However, he was rudely undeceived
by a gruff voice grunting out, “Come, none of this
nonsense!” At length a light was procured, and
as the boys filed out, one by one, their names were
entered in a “black list.”</p>

<p>The curious thing is that little organised effort
seems ever to have been made to prevent boys from
being allowed to enter the old inn; raiding them
when within its walls naturally did little good; in
fact, it merely stimulated the spirit of adventure
and made them go there more. A cousin of the
writer&mdash;well-known as master of the West Kent
foxhounds&mdash;describing Eton life under Hawtrey,
could not help speaking with glee of how he and a
companion were the only boys out of twenty who
managed to escape during one of these raids, the
perilous method adopted having been to climb
down a waterpipe and then drop into the yard at
the back.</p>

<p>The Christopher finally ended its career as a
hostelry in 1842, owing to the Crown giving up
the lease to the College. Its abolition had been
constantly urged ever since Dr. Hawtrey had become
Headmaster. A violent foe to the old inn and its
enemy, he branded it as the greatest evil in Eton
life, and after it had been numbered with things of
the past he was so pleased that, as a sort of thank-offering,
he wanted it to be pulled down and a
chapel of ease erected on the site. This scheme,
however, was not carried out, St. John’s Church
being built in the High Street instead and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Christopher turned into a boarding-house, the
tap-room becoming a court of justice, where petty
sessions were held.</p>

<p>Another part of the building was appropriated
to the use of the Eton Debating Society,
commonly called “Pop” (it is said, from “popina,”
an eating-house), which celebrated its centenary
in the present year. Its original domicile was
over the small shop of Mrs. Hatton, the confectioner,
quarters very useful for gratifying a love
of “sock.” It is said that at the Saturday four-o’clock
meetings the proceedings were often delayed
by the consumption of ices and cakes and the
drinking of cherry brandy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WILLIAM JOHNSON</div>

<p>The vestibule, where so many wild young bucks
had kicked their heels, was turned into a pupil room,
in which for a time presided one of the most gifted,
if eccentric, Eton masters who ever existed,
William Johnson (who afterwards changed his
name to Cory), the author of <cite>Ionica</cite> and of the
Eton boating song. Highly unconventional in his
ways, he could never remain unmoved when he
heard the sound of drums outside in the street,
indicating that some regiment was passing through
the College. Eton has given many a gallant
officer to England, and, as the large number of
memorials in the Chapel shows, the roll of Etonian
soldiers is associated with numberless glorious
memories. These stirred the imaginative mind of
the clever master, and, keenly desirous that the
rising generation should imbibe a due portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
that martial ardour which was the heritage of their
school, he would lead his pupils out to the archway,
and, pointing to the passing regiment, proudly
exclaim, “Boys, the British army!”</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson was an Eton master from 1845 to
1872, during which period he showed all the
qualifications of a gifted teacher, though at times
betraying considerable eccentricity. He was much
given to introspection, and amused boys would often
regale themselves with the sight of Billy Johnson,
as they irreverently called him, standing wrapt
in profound meditation all alone in the school-yard,
totally oblivious of everything about him. He
was very short-sighted, which gave rise to the
story that he had been seen furiously rushing down
Windsor Hill, making futile grabs at a fleeing hen,
which he believed to be his hat, blown off by the
wind. In school, owing to this infirmity, he was
unable to perceive what boys were doing, and the
carving of names and cutting into desks and forms
was carried on in perfect safety beneath his very
nose. Against positive disorder, however, he could
well defend himself, and his paradoxical utterances
and epigrammatic sayings kept even the most
turbulent spirits in check.</p>

<p>His powers of satire were generally recognised
as being highly formidable, and masters as well as
boys sometimes felt the keen thrust of his rapier.
In a school book, <cite>Nuces</cite>, written by him for the
use of the lower forms, was to be found a sentence
which Etonians universally agreed was a hit at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
somewhat unpopular master, conspicuous for the
length of his flowing beard. This ran: “Formerly
wise men used to grow beards. Now other persons
do so.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BOATING SONG</div>

<p>Though the poetical masterpiece of Mr. Johnson
is the small volume entitled <cite>Ionica</cite>, which contains
some beautiful verse, a more generally known
composition of his is the Eton boating song, which
has been carried by old Etonians practically all over
the world. An interesting account of how this
song came to be written is given by the Reverend
A. C. Ainger in his admirable work on <cite>Eton
in Prose and Verse</cite>. It would seem to have been
composed in the winter of 1863 for the 4th of June
of that year. Some little time later the words were
printed in the third number of a periodical called the
<cite>Eton Scrap-book</cite>, of which Everard Primrose was
one of the joint-editors. A copy of the words were
sent in 1865 to a subaltern in the Rifle Brigade,
Algernon Drummond by name, who was then
with his battalion at Nowshera, in India. This
young officer, who, four or five years before, had
been one of Johnson’s pupils, was haunted by the
words till the tune came to them, and eventually,
owing to him, a number of officers who had been at
Eton made a practice of singing it nightly after
mess. Gradually guests learnt it, with the result
that old Etonians in other regiments took to
singing the song which recalled to them their old
school in distant England.</p>

<p>The composition of this boating song, it should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
be added, cost William Johnson much trouble and
some sleepless nights; nevertheless, its final form
contains some lines which are scarcely worthy of an
author who, in <cite>Ionica</cite>, has shown himself a true
poet. It must, however, be remembered that the
song, as we have it, was never intended for the
wide publicity which it so speedily attained.
No doubt its popularity has been in a great
measure caused by the charming tune to which
it was set, whilst the whole-hearted and somewhat
touching devotion to Eton expressed in the words
makes an irresistible appeal to all true sons of
the school, particularly to those who remember
the days when, free from care, they passed many a
happy hour</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="indentbase">Skirting past the rushes,
</div><div class="indentone">Ruffling o’er the weeds,
</div><div class="indentbase">Where the lock stream gushes,
</div><div class="indentone">Where the cygnet feeds.
</div></div></div></div>

<p>The fact that “the rushes” are now no more,
having been entirely swept away by the great
flood of 1894, will not cause Etonians of a later
date to sing the words less heartily, and many a
generation yet to come will probably continue to
accord this boating song the appreciation which it
first obtained nearly half a century ago.</p>

<p>No man, perhaps, ever expressed better the
true Eton spirit than Mr. Johnson in some
words he uttered a few months before his
death. He was a sufferer from heart disease,
and realised that his end might at any time occur.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Declining a friend’s invitation, he said, “I think it
unmannerly to drop down dead in another man’s
grounds.”</p>

<p>The pupil room in which he sat has now ceased
to serve that purpose; the old structure of the
Christopher, having undergone further changes,
is now used merely to accommodate masters, and
has ceased to be an Eton house. The only
external trace of the inn yard as it was, are
some of the old balustrades of the ancient gallery
facing the site of the livery stables which were
swept away in 1901. Many will remember Charley
Wise, the proprietor, who used to be such a
familiar figure standing under the archway thirty
years ago.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHELLEY</div>

<p>The original sign of the Christopher, it should be
added, hangs at the modern Christopher in the High
Street. Shelley, when an Eton boy, one night stole
the great gilded bunch of grapes from this, and hung
it in front of the Headmaster’s door, so that the
astounded pedagogue ran into it as he was hurrying
into school in the morning. The whole character
of Shelley was a mass of contradictions, and he
seems to have been far from happy at school, where
he seldom joined in any sports; according to some
he never went on the river, but this is doubtful.
The young poet’s favourite ramble was Stoke Park
and the picturesque churchyard close by, rendered
famous for all time by Gray’s <cite>Elegy</cite>, of which
Shelley is said to have been very fond.</p>

<p>As was shown by the incident of the Christopher’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
grapes, Shelley, though as a rule of a meditative
disposition, was on occasion given to playing pranks.
He once bought a large brass cannon at an auction
in Windsor, and harnessed many Lower boys to
draw it down into College. It was captured by
one of the tutors and kept till the holidays at
Hexter’s. He was fond of experimenting in science,
and set fire to a tree in south meadow by laying
a train of gunpowder to it; another time, by
means of an electrical machine, he flung his tutor
against the wall.</p>

<p>This tutor’s name was Bethell, and, according
to all accounts, he was a somewhat unattractive
character. Amongst the boys he was known as
“Vox et praeterea nihil” and “Botch” Bethell,
because he was supposed always to be making
errors or botches in altering their verses. His
favourite phrase, which he used to alter as it
might be for a long or a short verse, was for the
former “sibi vindicat ipse,” for the latter “vindicat
ipse sibi,” in consequence of which an impudent
boy in his house, being one day asked at meal-time
what he would take, said, “Sir, I vindicate
to myself a slice of mutton.” Towards the
boys under his charge Bethell was harsh, and
sometimes even brutal. Meeting a Lower boy
one day coming in with a bowl full of sausages
covered by his hat to keep them warm, Bethell
sternly inquired, “What have you got there?”
The boy, fearing trouble, whimpered, “Nothing,
sir,” upon which Bethell jerked up the bowl with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
his hand and sent hat and sausages flying into the
road.</p>

<p>In Shelley’s day, life at Eton had changed a
good deal, compared with that led some twenty
years before, when Arthur Wellesley was a shy,
retiring Lower boy, in whom neither masters nor
schoolfellows saw any germs of future greatness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GREAT DUKE</div>

<p>He was about twelve years old when he went
to Miss Naylor’s, and in spite of his shyness he is
supposed to have taken part with his companions
in several escapades. Traditions used to be current
at Eton about his shooting expeditions up the river
at unpermitted seasons and hours; and during the
middle of the last century a tree standing near
the site of his dame’s was known as “the Duke’s
Tree,” because it was said that as a boy the old
duke had been fond of climbing it. Arthur
Wellesley was not very long at Eton, but nevertheless
in after life he cherished a great love for
the school to which in due course he sent his sons.
One of his first acts on going down to visit
them there was to take them to see the door
at his old house where, when a boy, he had cut
his own name. Though no great athlete himself,
he fully appreciated the manly character induced
by games and sport, and Creasy declares that not
many years before his death he was passing by the
playing fields, where numerous groups were happily
busied at their games of cricket. Pointing to
them, the old Field-Marshal said, “There grows
the stuff that won Waterloo.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>The great Duke’s elder brother, Lord Mornington,
afterwards Marquis of Wellesley, had, as is
well known, a fanatical love for Eton, where, by
his express wish, he was buried, his own beautiful
Latin lines<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> recording the satisfaction with which
he looked forward to resting there. According to
a request which he left behind him, six weeping
willows were planted in different parts of the
playing fields, and a bench fixed at a particular
spot which commanded his favourite view.</p>

<p>As an Eton boy he was a particularly fine
elocutionist, as was shown by two recitations of
his at Speeches on Election Monday 1778, before
a large number of royal visitors; in Strafford’s
dying speech he drew tears from the audience.
David Garrick, hearing of it, complimented the
youthful speaker on having done what he had
never achieved, namely, made the King weep. To
which the clever Etonian returned the graceful
answer, “That is because you never spoke to him
in the character of a fallen favourite.”</p>

<p>In many ways this brother of the Iron Duke
may be considered the type of the perfect Etonian,
and, as far as classical learning went, scarcely any
boy educated at the school ever equalled him.
When Dr. Goodall, a contemporary at Eton of
Lord Wellesley, was examined in 1818 before the
Education Committee of the House of Commons
respecting the alleged passing over of Porson in
giving promotions to King’s College, he at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
declared that the celebrated Greek scholar was
not by any means at the head of the Etonians of
his day; and on being asked by Lord Brougham,
the Chairman, to name his superior, he at once
said, “Lord Wellesley.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A SUGGESTION</div>

<p>Curiously enough, there appears to be no record
of where the young nobleman boarded. Presumably
it was at Miss Naylor’s, where later came
his illustrious brother. A commemorative tablet
should surely be set up near the spot where those
two great Etonians lived when Eton boys. The
houses where a number of other prominent men
spent their school days are for the most part
known, and several others might be honoured in
a similar manner, arousing a spirit of noble emulation
and pride in a splendid record of those who
have deserved well of their country.</p>

<p>A somewhat remarkable coincidence is that
George Canning, Gladstone, and the late Lord
Salisbury in turn boarded at the same house. In
Canning’s time the dame was Mrs. Harrington,
in Gladstone’s Mrs. Shurey, whilst in Lord
Robert Cecil’s day the Rev. G. Cookesley was in
control. Amongst modern politicians Lord Rosebery
boarded at Vidal’s, Mr. Balfour at Miss Evans’s,
Lord Curzon at Mr. Oscar Browning’s, and Mr.
Lewis Harcourt at the Rev. A. C. Ainger’s. The
room of the present Colonial Secretary was celebrated
as being the best decorated in Eton. The
writer has a vivid recollection of being impressed
by the number of well-arranged pictures which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
saw when, as a small boy, he enjoyed the honour
of being asked to breakfast there. The whole
place was full of evidences of the artistic taste
which admittedly distinguished Mr. Harcourt as
First Commissioner of Public Works.</p>

MONTEM</h2>


<p>Though even to-day a few old Etonians survive
who took part in the last Eton Montem, the
memory and the recollection of the quaint glories
of this ancient and unique festival will soon
have become totally obscured by the sordid dust
of modern life.</p>

<p>Whilst the lover of old customs may lament
that the merry voices of Montem are drowned for
ever, it is absolutely certain that even had the
famous triennial pageant been allowed to continue
after 1844, its celebration could never have been
prolonged up to the present day in its ancient
form; for, besides being utterly out of accord with
modern ideas and ways, the ceremony would have
brought such crowds to Eton as to have rendered
any procession to Salt Hill more or less impossible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
To some, however, it may be a matter for regret
that no attempt was made to perpetuate the memory
of Montem by holding a modified festival in the
playing fields.</p>

<p>It is all very well to denounce old customs as
merely useless relics of a bygone age. The individual
who carries such a view to an extreme
is in reality even more unreasonable than he
who delights in contemplating the past alone.
Both in their different ways are in the wrong:
the fanatical worshipper of ancient ways being apt
to lose sight of the improvements wrought by
progress, whilst he who despises antiquity forgets
that the state of society in which we live, and the
institutions of the country itself, are all derived
from preceding ages. Do or think what we will,
our ancestors are far more necessary to us than
posterity.</p>

<p>The tumulus or mound, to which the whole
school formerly marched in procession at Whitsuntide
once in every three years, stands in a field
just off the Bath road in the hamlet known as
Salt Hill. Supposed by some to be an ancient
barrow, it appears to have never been opened,
though a portion was sliced off in 1893 when some
cottages were built close by. It seems a pity
that this hillock&mdash;the scene of so many picturesque
gatherings in the past&mdash;should not have been
preserved intact, and some memorial, inscribed with
a brief account of the ceremony of Montem, placed
upon its summit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PARSON AND HIS CLERK</div>

<p>The exact origin of “Montem” is involved in
considerable obscurity. Perhaps the most plausible
explanation is that it arose in a similar manner as
the old Winchester custom of “going on Hills.”
Another theory is that the festival was of feudal
origin, the tenure of the College estates having
been held by the payment of “salt-silver”&mdash;an
ancient legal term signifying money paid by tenants
in certain manors in lieu of service of bringing
their lord’s salt from the market. It may have
also been originally connected with the curious
ceremony of electing a “Boy-Bishop.” In a number
of old Montem Lists, which the writer has been
fortunate enough to acquire, the parson occupies
a prominent place in the procession, coming immediately
after the Captain and being followed by
the clerk. Both ecclesiastical characters, it should
be added, were always personated by Collegers,
and it was the custom for them to indulge in
gross buffoonery, the parson delivering a burlesque
sermon on Salt Hill, down which he afterwards
kicked the clerk. In 1778 this proceeding so
scandalised Queen Charlotte, who was present,
that she begged it might never occur again, and
henceforth both parson and clerk ceased to figure
in the ceremony.</p>

<p>According to some, the original date for celebrating
Montem was December 6th, the very day
dedicated to St. Nicholas, and usually chosen for
the election of the “Boy-Bishop” in ancient times.
Be this as it may, in Elizabeth’s reign the procession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
took place about the feast of the Conversion
of St. Paul. Granted that it was ever celebrated
on St. Nicholas’ Day, those who derive it from the
“Boy-Bishop” have a coincidence of time in their
favour, whence it is not unreasonable to suppose a
connection between the triennial festival at Eton
and the ancient ecclesiastical mimicry of an episcopal
election. Another circumstance favourable to
the same supposition is found in a singular custom
which formerly made part of the Montem festival.
The parson at one period, receiving a Prayer-book,
used to read part of the Service to the crowd; which
usage bore an obvious resemblance to the mimic
services performed by the “Boy-Bishop” in the
distant past. Till 1759, when the date was
changed to Whit-Tuesday, Montem was annual;
it then became biennial, and finally after 1775
triennial.</p>

<p>In those days it had already assimilated some
striking features of that curious alliance of licensed
mendicity, brigandage, and gaiety&mdash;the modern
charity bazaar. Of its ancient character as a semi-religious
festival nothing remained, and it had
become a collection for the benefit of the Captain
of the Collegers who might have been fortunate
enough to obtain a vacancy at King’s College,
Cambridge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“MONTEM-SURE”</div>

<p>The proceedings in College which heralded
the approach of Montem were characteristic and
peculiar. In former days it was the custom that any
vacancy at King’s should be immediately announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
at Eton by the “resignation man,” generally the
coachman of the Provost of that College, a delay
of three weeks all but a day being allowed to the
Captain of the school in which he might make his
preparations for leaving. If, however, this period
of grace should chance to expire on the very eve
of Whitsun-Tuesday Montem-day, the right of
being Captain would lapse to the Colleger who was
next on the list, so that the twentieth day before
Whitsun-Tuesday in that year was a very critical
day for the Captain and second Colleger. Till
midnight it could not be known for certain who
would be Captain. The boys called that night
“Montem-Sure Night,” when wild excitement
prevailed amongst the Collegers in Long Chamber,
and as the last stroke of midnight sounded from
the clock in Lupton’s Tower, some fifty-two stout
oaken beds would be let fall on to the floor with a
thundering crash, numberless shutters would be
slammed with furious energy, and “Montem-Sure,”
shouted by many powerful young throats, would
ring out all over Eton.</p>

<p>Whoever was Captain of the school on the
Whitsun-Tuesday in a Montem year became
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</i> Captain of Montem. But, as has before
been said, the Captain of the school could not be
known for certain till within twenty days of the
eventful Whitsun-Tuesday.</p>

<p>A King’s scholar could, if he succeeded in passing
his “election trials” every year at the end of July,
remain at Eton a twelvemonth after passing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
last examination, provided he was not yet nineteen.
If by that time he had not gone to King’s College,
Cambridge, he was superannuated, and had to leave
Eton. At the examination at the end of every
July those boys who had passed their eighteenth
birthday were placed in school order of merit, and
were called from thence to Cambridge at any time
of the year, whenever, through death, marriage, or
any cause, a vacancy occurred in the number of
the seventy members of King’s College, in order
to supply which King Henry VI. founded his
school at Eton of seventy scholars. Montem only
happened every third year, for which reason it was
only possible that a boy who was born in such a
year that he would have passed his eighteenth
birthday on the July previous to a Montem could
ever become captain of Montem, and obtain the
financial benefits accruing from the collection made
at that festival.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“SALT! SALT”</div>

<p>William Malim, the Headmaster, who wrote an
account of Eton for the Royal Commission who
visited the school in 1561, thus described the
Montem of his day:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>About the festival of the Conversion of Saint Paul, at
nine o’clock on a day chosen by the Master, in the accustomed
manner in which they go to collect nuts in September, the
boys go ad montem. The hill is a sacred spot according to
the boyish religion of the Etonians; on account of the beauty
of the countryside, the delicious grass, the cool shade of
bowers, and the melodious chorus of birds, they make it a
holy shrine for Apollo and the Muses, celebrate it in songs,
call it Tempe, and extol it above Helicon. Here the novices
or new boys, who have not yet submitted to blows in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Eton ranks, manfully and stoutly, for a whole year, are
first seasoned with salt and then separately described in little
poems which must be as salted and graceful as possible.
Next, they make epigrams against the new boys, one vying
with another to surpass in all elegance of speech and in
witticisms. Whatever comes to the lips may be uttered
freely so long as it is in Latin, courteous, and free from
scurrility. Finally they wet their faces and cheeks with salt
tears, and then at last they are initiated in the rites of the
veterans. Ovations follow, and little triumphs, and they
rejoice in good earnest, because their labours are past, and
because they are admitted to the society of such pleasant
comrades. These things finished they turn home at five
o’clock and after dinner play till eight.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the days of Elizabeth, and during the
turbulent time of the Civil War, Montem
seems to have assumed a more regular and
ceremonious form. Only, however, at the beginning
of the eighteenth century did it acquire those
military characteristics which it retained with little
modification till its abolition in 1847. Till the
middle of the eighteenth century (1759) it was
held in the last week in January, but at that date
Whitsun-Tuesday was appointed as the great day.
Dr. Barnard it was who altered the dresses and
formed the boys into a regular collegiate regiment.</p>

<p>In ancient times the collectors, that is to say the
boys who scoured the roads for miles round Eton
to collect contributions, carried large bags which
actually contained salt, a pinch of which they gave
to every contributor as a receipt. In the rough
old times, when any boorish-looking countryman
after having contributed a trifle asked for salt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
it used to be a favourite pleasantry to fill his
mouth with it. The last Montem at which salt
was actually used seems to have been that of
1793. The cry of “Salt! Salt!” lasted long after
tickets had taken the place of the condiment,
and, indeed, endured to the end, embroidered bags
being proffered to travellers along the roads,
who, in return for contributions which varied from
fifty pounds to sixpence, were presented with
little blue tickets inscribed with one of the
Latin Montem mottoes. In the years preceding
the abolition of the ceremony, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mos pro Lege</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pro More et Monte</i> were used in alternate years.
Not infrequently people who had never heard of
the ancient custom were very much astonished at
being asked for salt. William the Third, it is said,
soon after his accession, had his carriage stopped
by Montem runners on the Bath road, and his
Dutch guards, being not unnaturally indignant at
their monarch being waylaid in such unceremonious
fashion, were only prevented from cutting down
the boys, whom they took for some kind of highwaymen,
by the King himself, who good-naturedly
gave the salt-bearers a liberal contribution.</p>

<p>In 1706 Montem would seem to have evolved
into something of the same form which it retained
till its abolition, the organisation being of a military
kind. In that year Stephen Poyntz was
captain, Berkeley Seymour lieutenant, Theophilus
Thompson ensign, and Anthony Allen marshal, or,
as the Montem List always termed it, “mareschal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MARCH TO SALT HILL</div>

<p>In connection with the ceremony, Poyntz composed
the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentbase">Allen pandit iter, Poyntz instruit agmen,
</div><div class="indentbase">Cogit iter Seymour Thompsonque insignia vibrat.
</div></div></div></div>

<p>I think I am right in saying that it has hitherto
escaped notice that the great Duke of Wellington
took part in an “ad Montem.” An old list in
my possession shows that at the Montem of
June 5th, 1781, Mr. Wesley, as he is termed,
marched to Salt Hill as one of the attendants of an
Upper boy named Lomax. An appended note
adds, “His Grace’s first appearance in arms.”
His sons, Lord Douro and Lord Charles Wellesley,
marched in the processions of 1820 and 1823.</p>

<p>At the Montem of 1826 Gladstone, in order
evidently to express that sympathy for downtrodden
nations for which he was so celebrated
in after life, went to Salt Hill in Greek costume
wearing the fustanella and embroidered cap. This
was Pickering’s Montem, and owing to Gladstone
and others repressing a good deal of wanton
damage, the sum obtained for him was one of
the largest on record.</p>

<p>The march to Salt Hill was, of course, always
somewhat tumultuous, and much licence prevailed.
As time went on efforts were made to purge the
fête of its disorderly features, but up to the very
end there was a good deal of horseplay and rowdiness
amongst the boys; indeed, at the last Montem
but one, in 1841, they did great damage to the
inns at Salt Hill, whilst it was rare that the gardens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of these hostelries came unscathed through the
eventful day, owing to the boys slashing the plants
and bushes with their swords. If the Captain of
Montem happened to be unpopular, much damage
was often done, the boys being well aware that on
him would fall the burden of compensation, which
had to be paid out of the Montem money; and it is
said that on one occasion an unfortunate Captain
was actually out of pocket owing to the compensation
he had to pay.</p>

<p>Montem commenced by a number of the senior
boys taking post upon the bridges or other leading
places of all the avenues around Windsor and Eton
soon after the dawn of day. These runners (or
“servitors,” as the Montem List calls them) were
indefatigable in collecting salt or money from
every one whom they came across, and for seven
or eight miles around Eton travellers were liable
to be accosted. The runners who worked in outlying
districts generally drove in a gig, being
accompanied by an attendant dressed in white&mdash;well
able to protect the runners against violence
or robbery. The total of the sums collected was
afterwards given to the two salt-bearers&mdash;one
Colleger and one Oppidan&mdash;Upper boys who
marched in the rear of the procession. In the
earlier part of the day these functionaries remained
in the precincts of College. The twelve runners
were gorgeously attired in fancy dresses of various
kinds, bright colours predominating; they wore
plumed hats and buff boots, and carried silken bags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
strengthened with netting to hold the “salt”&mdash;that
is the money which they obtained. Their peculiar
badges of office were painted staves emblazoned
with mottoes at the top, which in most cases
consisted of short quotations from Virgil or Horace.
“Quando ita majores” was a favourite one. Occasionally,
however, the motto was modern, “Nullum
jus sine sale,” for instance. Contributors of “salt”
received in return a small dated ticket inscribed
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pro More et Monte</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mos pro Lege</i>. This, placed
in a hat or pinned on to a coat, would pass any
one free with all runners for the rest of the day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MONTEM MORNING</div>

<p>Nothing could have been prettier or more
animated than the old school-yard the morning
of a Montem, filled as it was with the boys in
their military uniforms of blue and red, or in fancy
dresses, for the most part of a rich and tasteful
kind. Fantastically attired Turks, Albanians, and
Highlanders mingled with courtiers and pages of
every age, an additional note of colour being
furnished by the bright dresses of numerous female
relatives and friends who had come down to Eton
to see the show. In addition to the boys in
uniform and fancy dress, a considerable number
of Lower School who followed at the end of the
procession wore the old Eton costume of blue
jacket and white trousers, only abandoned after
the death of George III. Such boys carried long
thin wands about five feet long, which after the
ceremonial were, according to immemorial usage,
cut in two by the corporals with their swords.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Occasionally, however, some of the “polemen,” as
they were called, contrived to keep their wands intact
to the end of the day&mdash;a rare and difficult feat.</p>

<p>At the close of the eighteenth century Montem
was often attended by Royalty. The College flag,
of rich crimson silk emblazoned with the Eton
arms and the motto <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mos pro Lege</i> within a wreath
of oak and laurel, would on the great day be displayed
at one of the Long Chamber windows early
in the morning, and at eleven o’clock George III.
would generally appear with his family, and be
received by the boys with a long-continued roar of
huzzas. The King would then be met by the
Headmaster at the entrance to the school-yard and
conducted to an elaborate breakfast, after which
the Royal party would move with the procession
towards Salt Hill, the principal scene of the day’s
display. A breakfast given by the Captain of
Montem in the College Hall continued to be one of
the features of the day right up to the last celebration
in 1844. In the <cite>Illustrated London News</cite> of
that year can be seen, amongst other interesting
pictures of the last Montem, a cut of this banquet.
The unrestored Hall is filled with guests, the
College flag being suspended above the High Table.
After the feast general exhilaration prevailed.
My cousin, Sir Algernon West&mdash;a survivor of the
last Montem, which he attended as a “poleman”&mdash;tells
me that he has an unpleasant memory of a
schoolfellow, who had partaken of the pleasures of
the table too freely, prodding him with a sword.</p>

<p>The procession always commenced in the Great
Quadrangle at Eton, and proceeded through Eton
to Slough, and round to Salt Hill, where the
boys all passed before the King or Queen and
ascended the Montem; here an oration was
delivered, and the Grand Standard was displayed
with much grace and activity by the Standard-bearer,
selected from among the senior boys.</p>

<p>There were two extraordinary salt-bearers
appointed to attend the Royalties; these salt-bearers
were always attired in fanciful habits,
generally costly and sometimes superb, and each
carried an embroidered bag, which not only received
the royal salt, but also whatever was collected by
the out-stationed runners.</p>

<p>The donation of the King or Queen, or, as it
was called, “the royal salt,” was always fifty guineas
each; the Prince of Wales thirty guineas; all the
other Princes and Princesses twenty guineas each.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WINDMILL</div>

<p>As soon as the ceremony “ad Montem” was over
the Royal Family returned to Windsor. The boys
then dined in detachments&mdash;seniors separated from
juniors&mdash;in the taverns at Salt Hill, the gardens
at that place being laid out for such ladies and
gentlemen as chose to take any refreshment, whilst
several bands of music played. The “Windmill
Inn,” the garden of which was on the other side
of the road, was then often the scene of much riotous
festivity, as was a rival house&mdash;the “Castle.”
The abolition of Montem was, of course, a severe
blow to both hostelries. About twenty-five years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
ago the “Windmill” was about to be converted into
a school when a fire broke out and the old building
was destroyed. A noticeable feature of the
exterior had been some magnificent wistaria, the
stems of which were twisted into agonised shapes
by the flames. The “Castle” actually did become
a school. A large part of the original house was
pulled down in 1887 and the rest of the place
converted into a compact country residence. The
“Windmill” was known to many as “Botham’s,”
from the name of its proprietor, who in the palmy
days of Montem during the last century divided
what was a profitable monopoly with the host of the
“Castle,” Partridge by name. The latter’s charges
were so high that Foote, after partaking of some
refreshment in his hostelry, once told him that
he ought to change his name to Woodcock&mdash;“on
account of the length of his bill.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">FINANCIAL RESULTS</div>

<p>After having dined at these inns all the boys
returned in the same order of procession as in the
morning, and, marching round the Great Quadrangle
in Eton School, were dismissed. In the eighteenth
century the Captain would then go and pay his
respects to the Royal Family at the Queen’s
Lodge, Windsor, previous to his departure for
King’s College, Cambridge; to defray which expense
the produce of the Montem was presented
to him. Upon Whit-Tuesday in the year 1796
it amounted to over one thousand guineas.
The sum, however, varied considerably in amount,
its magnitude being in a great manner determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
by his popularity or unpopularity in the
school. In the latter case, as has been said, the
result of the collection would sometimes be a
good deal diminished by damage done in the
gardens of the inns at Salt Hill, where ill-disposed
boys would destroy the shrubs and flowers with
their swords in order to run up the bill. All the
other expenses of the day were paid for out of the
Salt, and in the latter years of Montem the total
collected generally amounted to something between
a thousand and eight hundred pounds; but when all
disbursements had been made the Captain was very
lucky if he got three or four hundred pounds. A
proof of this is that when Montem was discontinued
in 1847, Dr. Hawtrey gave the boy who would have
been Captain two hundred pounds contributed by
himself and a few friends out of their own pockets
as compensation. This sum the Headmaster had
ascertained was a fair equivalent for the net amount
usually pocketed by the Captain after all expenses
had been paid. These outgoings, it must be remembered,
were large, including as they did a breakfast
to the whole of the Fifth and Sixth Forms and
a dinner to personal friends in the evening, in
addition to which there were numerous other disbursements
which amounted to a considerable sum.</p>

<p>In an early account of Montem <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</i> 1560 there
is a reference to the new boys, termed “recentes,”
being seasoned with salt, meaning probably that
they had to make some small monetary contribution;
for up to the last Montem celebration, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
reason of a curious usage, the origin of which was
unknown, boys who had come to Eton within the
preceding year were expected to pay the Captain
a small sum called “recent-money.”</p>

<p>At the last celebrations of Montem the order of
procession differed somewhat from that observed in
olden days. It was then headed by the marshal,
followed by six attendants; band; captain, followed
by eight attendants; sergeant-major, followed by
two attendants; twelve sergeants, two and two,
each followed by an attendant; colonel, followed
by six attendants and four polemen; corporals,
two and two, followed by two polemen apiece;
second band; ensign with flag, followed by six
attendants and four polemen; corporals, two and
two, followed by one or two polemen apiece;
lieutenant, followed by four attendants; salt-bearers,
runners, and stewards; and a poleman
brought up the rear of the procession.</p>

<p>The flag was always solemnly waved in the
school-yard before the procession started, and on
arriving at Salt Hill it was waved a second time at
the top of the mount, the boys all clustering round
like a swarm of bees and cheering with great vigour.
Great importance was always attached to the
waving of the College standard in a proper manner,
and for a long time previous to Montem day the
Ensign practised for hours in Long Chamber. The
old traditional way of manipulating the banner was
as far as possible followed, the custom being to
wave it round in every direction and conclude by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
one triumphant final flourish which was the grand
climax of the whole celebration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN ETON REGIMENT</div>

<p>A complete military organisation with regular
uniforms was adopted by the school on Montem
day, and Eton became a collegiate regiment. The
senior Colleger ranked as captain, the second salt-bearer
as marshal, the other Sixth-Form Collegers
becoming ensign, lieutenant, sergeant-major, and
steward; any other Sixth-Form Collegers not acting
as runners were sergeants. The captain of the
Oppidans was always a salt-bearer by right, whilst
the next to him on the school list was colonel; the
other Sixth-Form Oppidans ranked as sergeants.
All the Fifth-Form Oppidans were corporals and
wore red tail-coats with gilt buttons and white
trousers. They had also crimson sashes round their
waists, black leather sword-belts, and swords hanging
by their sides. A cocked hat and plume of feathers
exactly like that worn by field-officers completed
this martial attire. The Fifth-Form Collegers’ dress
was like that of the Fifth-Form Oppidans, insomuch
as they donned sash, sword, cocked hat, and plume;
but their coats were blue instead of red, so that
they resembled naval officers more than military
men. The coats of the Sixth Form, both Collegers
and Oppidans, had distinctive details of uniform
denoting rank, which could be at once distinguished
from the various forms of epaulet and great or
little prevalence of gilt. The steward wore the
ordinary full dress of the period. The Lower boys
who acted as polemen wore the old Eton costume&mdash;blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
coats with gilt buttons, white waistcoats
and trousers, silk stockings and pumps. The pages
of the Sixth Form and others were attired in fancy
dresses, often of a rich description. A feature
of the last Montem uniforms were the buttons.
These bore the Eton arms, Royal crown, and
motto, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mos pro Lege</i>, together with the date
of the foundation of the College.</p>

<p>Montem coats were allowed to be worn after
the great day was over, but the boys suffered for
this privilege, most masters generally selecting
them to construe in preference to their more
soberly clad schoolmates. One master, indeed,
became so notorious for this that eventually his
whole division appeared in red coats, so as to
prevent any particular boys from being singled out.
The last Montem coat worn at Eton is said to
have been observed in 1847.</p>

<p>As a general rule pretty good order seems to
have been preserved in connection with Montem,
and this is the more wonderful when one remembers
that a large number of the boys wore real
swords and indulged in liberal potations at the
inns at Salt Hill. In 1796, it is true, some disorder
did occur near the historic mount, a large crowd
surging around the carriage in which sat the
Queen and the Princesses. George III., however,
soon put matters to rights by calling out to some of
the worst offenders, “Surely you are not Etonians?”
adding that he did not remember their faces, and
felt sure Eton boys would be better behaved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Three years later, at the Montem of 1799, an Eton
boy made a mistake of which he was afterwards
much ashamed. As the procession was moving
along, a visitor on a spirited and fiery horse kept
pressing closer to it than was pleasant, and one of
the sergeants, a youth named Beckett, putting one
hand significantly upon his sword-hilt and the
other on the rider’s knee, exclaimed in a bold
manner, “I should recommend you, my friend, not
to let your horse tread upon Me.” In reply to this
the horseman merely smiled, bowed, and drew his
horse away. It was afterwards discovered that the
stranger was the King of Hanover. Altogether
Montem was a day of great enjoyment for those
who were present at it, much jollity and fun of the
old English sort being one of its chief characteristics.
Most of the visitors were well acquainted
with its traditions and entered thoroughly into its
spirit. A favourite joke was to make a pretence
of refusing to contribute whilst concealing the
little blue paper receipt previously received as
quittance for salt paid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PLEASURES OF MONTEM</div>

<p>“I will not attempt to reason with you about
the pleasures of Montem,” said an old Etonian,
who was defending the old festival against the
attacks of one of those hawk-eyed commercial
gamblers who, calling themselves “business men,”
dominate the modern world; “but to an Etonian it
is enough that it brought pure and ennobling recollections&mdash;evoked
associations of hope and happiness&mdash;and
made even the wise feel that there was something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
better than wisdom, and the rich something
nobler than wealth. I like to think of the faces I
saw round the old mount, recalling school friendships
and generous rivalries. At the last Montem
I attended, it is true I saw fifty fellows of whom
I remember only the nicknames&mdash;not a few
degenerated into scheming M.P.’s, cunning
lawyers, or speculators&mdash;but at Montem one
forgot all that. Leaving the plodding world of
reality for one day, such men regained the dignity
of Sixth-Form Etonians.”</p>

<p>The last celebration of Montem took place
on Whitsun-Tuesday in 1844, on which occasion
some of its ancient features were altered. The
dinner, for instance, took place on Fellow’s Eyot,
within the College precincts, instead of at Salt
Hill, the boys having also to answer to their names
in the playing fields. An ominous sign, which
seemed to forebode that the ancient ceremony
was soon to be discontinued for ever, was
that in the last year of Montem the famous
cry of “Montem Sure” was not heard to ring
out of the Long Chamber windows, no bedsteads
crashed, and no shutters banged. Montem, it is
true, still lived, but it seemed to be felt that its end
was near. Nevertheless, the procession took place
according to immemorial usage, and the fancifully
attired throng of boys, accompanied by a crowd of
carriages, foot and horse, wended its way to the
classic mount where the ceremonial which countless
generations of Etonians had gone through was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
duly performed. Prince Albert, for instance, was
stopped on Windsor Bridge, and in compliance
with a request for salt, gave £100. At Salt Hill
the bands played merrily, and the crowd of boys
and old Etonians cheered as of yore when, for the
last time on the summit of the mount the Ensign
waved the historic College banner, inscribed with
the quaint old motto, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pro More et Monte</i>. Not
a few, however, amongst the throng gathered
there had a presentiment that they were assisting
at the obsequies of the time-honoured ceremony,
and as they wended their way back to town felt
that Montem was now to be numbered with the
many other old-world festivals which so-called
progress was sweeping away.</p>

<p>These gloomy forebodings proved to be only
too well founded. Montem, indeed, had become
somewhat incongruous with the changed spirit
which was producing a purely utilitarian age. The
facilities afforded by the then newly constructed
railway also flooded Eton and Slough with hordes
of visitors, many of them highly undesirable,
besides which the Press was none too tender in the
attitude which it adopted towards the old festival.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE “HOLBORN MONTEM”</div>

<p>In June 1844, for instance, <cite>Punch</cite> published
an amusing, if rather malicious, illustrated attack
upon the Eton festival, entitled “The Holborn
Montem,” in which it pictured the effect which
would be produced were a number of London
ragamuffins permitted to hold up foot-passengers
and omnibuses whilst making demands for salt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Dr. Hawtrey, the Headmaster, was bitterly opposed
to the continuance of the old ceremony, and to
him and to the Provost it owed its abolition. The
remainder of the College authorities were about
equally divided in their opinions. When Provost
Hodgson put the matter before them they voted
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="mont" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="Montem">
<tr><td class="monttitle"><em>For abolishing Montem.</em></td><td class="monttitle"><em>For preserving Montem.</em></td></tr>
<tr><td class="montname">Hodgson, Provost.</td><td class="montname1">Plumtre.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="montname">Grover, Vice-Provost.</td><td class="montname1">Carter.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="montname">Bethell.</td><td class="montname1">Dupuis.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="montname">Green.</td><td class="montname1">Wilder.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Queen Victoria personally is known to have
been opposed to the abolition; nevertheless she did
not care to interfere, and in 1847 it was announced
that no celebration of Montem would take place,
and though many earnest representations were
made by old Etonians to Dr. Hawtrey, the decision
to abolish Montem was maintained. Had the
Provost been of the same type as Dr. Goodall, some
semblance at least of the ancient ceremony would
have been preserved, but the post happened to be
held by Provost Hodgson, the friend of Byron,
who, though a man of poetical turn of mind, was
a great reformer. He made many changes in
College, and abolished the horrors of Long
Chamber, which is much to his credit. On the
other hand, he was perhaps too thorough-going in
doing away with the ancient festival of Montem,
which might have been preserved in an altered
form. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Per se</i> it was, in many respects, indefensible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
being full of absurdities; nevertheless it might have
been continued in some reformed and improved
shape.</p>

<p>The abolition was keenly resented by the boys,
and on the Whit-Tuesday, when the ceremony
should have taken place, the old red flag, which had
figured at many Montems, was hung out of one of
the windows of Upper School as a signal of revolt,
and something like a riot ensued. This was, however,
in the main confined to the Lower boys,
who, after smashing a few windows (for the repair
of which their parents afterwards grumblingly
paid), were soon reduced to order.</p>

<p>Numbers of old Etonians sadly shook their
heads when they heard that Montem had become
a thing of the past, but, as has been said, remonstrance
and protest were alike unavailing to make
the Eton authorities realise that entire abolition
was too drastic a measure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BONE FOR THE MARROW</div>

<p>The truth is that at that period all over
England old-fashioned merrymaking was beginning
to be checked by the chilling force of that
utilitarian commercialism which has since dominated
the country. The modern spirit, ever prone
to exchange happiness for success, was already
making its influence felt, whilst many, under
the false impression that romance, tradition, and
fancy counted for nothing, were straining every
nerve to secure the bone whilst entirely failing to
obtain its marrow.</p>

<p>The passing of Montem, besides causing some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
severe pangs of grief to many an old Etonian,
greatly perturbed a number of humbler folk, and
its abolition was bitterly lamented by a host of
tradesmen, cabmen, omnibus drivers, innkeepers,
and the like. Numbers of people derived either
pleasure or profit from the triennial celebration.
The most sincere mourners were the cab and
omnibus drivers, who bitterly regretted their
lost harvest, and on the anniversary of the great
festival wore black crape upon their arms.</p>

<p>An interesting and curious exhibition of Montem
relics and costumes, it may be mentioned, was shown
at Eton in the Upper School during the celebration
of the 450th anniversary of the foundation of
the College. Of the three great Eton festivals,
Montem, Election Saturday, and the 4th of
June, the last and most modern of the three
alone survives. The proceedings on Election
Saturday, it should be added, were of a similar
kind to those which still take place on the birthday
of King George the Third&mdash;that is to say,
the boats’ crews wore gala dresses and dined at
Surly, after which there were fireworks, whilst
the bells of Windsor pealed and the crews cheered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MONTEM ODES</div>

<p>Before leaving the subject of Montem a few
words may not be out of place as to a quaint
character who was known to many generations
of Etonians as the Montem poet. This was
Herbert Stockhore, who, dressed in quaint attire
in a donkey-cart, was a prominent feature at all
Montem celebrations from 1784 to 1835, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
he was ninety. Before being chosen Montem
poet Stockhore was a Windsor bricklayer living in
a little house built by himself, which he called
Mount Pleasant, in a lane leading from Windsor
to the meadows.</p>

<p>On the 4th of June good old George III.
always presented Stockhore with a present of
gold, and George IV. continued the kindly practice.
At other times Stockhore subsisted entirely upon
the bounty of the Etonians and the inhabitants of
Windsor and Eton, who never failed to administer
to his wants and liberally supply him with many
little comforts in return for his harmless pleasantries.</p>

<p>Stockhore had a time-honoured method of composing
his odes well calculated to ensure their
favourable reception. The quality of his versification
was, of course, very moderate. It may be
judged from the following, culled from the Montem
Ode of 1826 (Pickering’s year):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentone">I, Herbert Stockhore, once more,
</div><div class="indentone">In spite of age and pains rheumatic,
</div><div class="indentone">Hop down to “Montem” with verses Attic,
</div><div class="indentone">To make the Muse as have done before.
</div><div class="indentbase">For why should I lie a-bed groaning and bickering
</div><div class="indentbase">When I ought to be up to sing Captain Pickering.
</div></div></div></div>

<p>A happier effort, perhaps, was his greeting to
George III.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentbase">And now we’ll sing
</div><div class="indentbase">God save the king,
</div><div class="indentone">And send him long to reign,
</div><div class="indentbase">That he may come
</div><div class="indentbase">To have some fun
</div><div class="indentone">At Montem once again.
</div></div></div></div>

<p>It is not, however, on account of his rhymes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
that Stockhore deserves to be remembered, but
on account of the fact that he was one of the last
of those lowly-born characters who by their native
wit, good-humour, and kindly eccentricity secured
a unique place in the affections of many far above
them in rank, intellect, and wealth. The Board
School has now rendered all such humble types
extinct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HERBERT STOCKHORE</div>

<p>Stockhore had originally been a sailor, and some
said also a soldier. At any rate on “Montem”
day he wore a fancy robe of various colours thrown
over his old military coat, with trimmings of divers
cotton ribbons. An extemporised coronet, encircled
with bay and crowned with feathers, completed
a costume which astounded visitors unaware
of the bard’s identity. His eccentric though harmless
habits rendered him a popular character with
the Eton boys, and his recitation of a Montem
Ode was always warmly applauded, and owing to
the sale of his doggerel and the contributions he
received the old man led a fairly comfortable
existence. His way was first of all to set down
upon paper the names of those about to take part
in “Montem” and other details furnished to him
by some one in a position to know, after which he
would compose a rough jumble of rhyming lines.
This was then submitted to some Colleger, who
undertook its revision, and was printed for the
author to vend, which he did at a very remunerative
price; it also formed an excuse for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
extraction of coins from old friends and visitors
to Eton. Stockhore, though in his latter years,
like his rhymes, much given to limping, was able
to attend the Montem of 1835, at which time he
had reached the great age of ninety.</p>

<p>At the next one, held in 1838, though still alive,
being too feeble to go, he was represented at the
great festival by a man named Ryder. Three
years later, in 1841, Stockhore passed away, aged
ninety-six years. The boys then chose Edward
Irvine by vote, but though he or some other
claimant was still hanging about Eton half a
century ago, the office really died with Stockhore,
for his successors had no trace of the quaint and
simple individuality which had been known to
many generations of Etonians, one of whom, a
few years before the famous Montem poet’s death,
composed the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>The “famous hill” alluded to in these verses
now presents a most melancholy appearance, its
summit being vulgarised by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">châlet</i> of miserable
design, whilst, as has been said, the glory of the
Inns close by has long departed. For some time
after Montem days, however, the Windmill
(Botham’s) seems to have been an occasional resort
of Etonians, for an interesting oak table (saved
from the fire), which is now in the possession of the
popular Master&mdash;Mr. Edward Littleton Vaughan&mdash;has
carved upon it the names of some seventy
well-known Etonians, besides initials, and dates,
mostly ranging from 1845 to 1857. It would
therefore seem that, contrary to tradition, the names
were not carved after Montem, but are rather those
of boys who frequented Botham’s, as their predecessors
had frequented the old Christopher.</p>

<h2>VI<br />
THE COLLEGE BUILDINGS</h2>


<p>In the course of the various changes which Eton
has undergone, the old Quadrangle (till 1706 not
paved but grass), which in old Montem days was
gay with a riot of high-spirited youth, has, on the
whole, escaped disfiguring alteration. The original
intention of the founder was to have a cloister
in the Quadrangle; and a line of lead running
beneath the windows, together with some foundations
discovered in 1876, lead one to suppose that
such a scheme was actually begun. On the whole,
the general aspect of the school-yard, which
enthusiastic Etonians regard as a sort of “rose-red
city half as old as time,” remains unaltered.
New, however, are the pinnacles of the Chapel
and the Gothic window of the Hall.</p>

<p>Within the last hundred years almost the only
drastic changes have been those in its exterior,
the western end of which was remodelled at the
restoration of 1858, and the construction of a bow
window for the master residing in College, whose
rooms are on the left-hand side of the Quadrangle,
at the end of what was formerly the ancient Long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Chamber. Otherwise there is small evidence of
change. The brickwork retains its old mellowed
colouring, and the founder’s statue remains as grimy
as ever, though perhaps a trifle less black than in
the days when its sable hue convinced the small
child of one of the College officials that Henry VI.
had been a black man. The infant in question, as a
loyal son of Eton, had been taught to salute this
statue (which, according to old custom, should
always be passed on the right-hand side) whenever
he went through the school-yard. Out for an airing
with its nurse in Windsor one day, the child,
perceiving a private of one of the West India
Regiments, became convinced that it was Henry
VI. in the flesh. Solemnly rising in its perambulator
and reverently exclaiming “Founder,” the
astounded soldier was accorded a salute which
filled him with amazement.</p>

<p>The feature of the Quadrangle, of course, is the
fine tower of Provost Lupton, under which at
Election time, up to 1871, the Provost of Eton
was wont to greet the Provost of King’s with a
kiss of peace, and the Captain of the school to
deliver his Latin Cloister Speech. The gates here
are closed on the death of a Provost, and not
opened till his successor is appointed. Carved
above the window of Election Chamber, over the
gateway, is a representation of the Assumption
of the Virgin, to which in pre-Reformation days
Collegers reverently raised their hats.</p>

<p>Passing through this arch one reaches the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
cloisters, about which linger so many old-world
memories. Once known as the “tower cloister,”
this appellation seems in the eighteenth century
to have been discarded for that of “the Green
Yard.” The railings here, of Sussex iron, were
put up in 1724-25.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">CHANGES IN CLOISTERS</div>

<p>A good many alterations have recently been
carried out in this part of the College, some of
which have of necessity rather impaired its old-world
charm.</p>

<p>On the cloister side of Lupton’s Tower a
strengthening arch and support have been built
to guard against possible subsidence, some signs
of which had begun to appear. In the cloisters
also certain expedient changes and renovations
have also been made.</p>

<p>During the middle of the eighteenth century
an additional storey was added to the cloister
buildings, and, owing to the narrowness of the
structure, communication between the new storey
and the old was eventually effected by affixing a
staircase to the outside wall, in which a hole was
made to give entrance to the staircase. This
staircase has now been entirely removed, and a
new staircase between the first and second floors
fitted in two flights, each stretching the whole
breadth of the building. Election Hall now
occupies practically the whole of the space between
Lupton’s Tower and the north side of school-yard.
Formerly there was a small room at the tower
end, and a passage past this room communicating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
with Election Chamber on the lowest floor of the
tower. This room is now part of Election Hall,
most of the passage having disappeared, whilst the
beautiful oak panelling has been removed to the
new staircase. The roof of Election Hall is now
higher than of yore, the increased size of the room
and the bad state of the roof having called for such
an alteration. The room over Election Chamber
has been converted into a sitting-room, and the
partitions in it have been removed, so that it is
now the same size as Election Chamber and looks
out both ways. The clock remains unchanged.
In the remoter part of the house the passage has
been widened, and the walls have been stripped of
the plaster and now show the old timber. A new
door has also been made under the tower, giving
access to a staircase which leads straight up to the
first floor.</p>

<p>The Provost’s Lodge has also undergone some
change. The dining-room here&mdash;the Magna
Parlura&mdash;which contains portraits of various kings
and provosts and occupies the centre of the Lodge,
has undergone considerable renovation at certain
periods, especially in the middle of the last century,
when it was decorated with considerable care by
Dr. Hawtrey. The ceiling was then painted and
the panelling, reaching to the top of the room,
finished with a dado of deal, which has now been
removed, and the oak, which before was grained,
scraped. The panelling has also been lowered and
now rests on the floor, the old timbers above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
being visible. Two stone windows have been
opened up in this room, which had formerly been
blocked by the Georgian staircase. At the other
end of the room an interesting discovery was made
of another Tudor door opening into the gallery just
opposite the stairs. On each side of the door are
Tudor windows with wooden frames. Most of the
doors opening into the gallery are of Tudor workmanship,
but these are the only two Tudor windows
that have been discovered in the College. The
woodwork half-way down the staircase is of good
Gothic workmanship, whereas the staircase is of
much later date. The servants’ hall, on the ground
floor, was formerly divided by partitions, but these
have been removed. The panelling here is of the
seventeenth century, the panels large and tall in
design. At one end of the room there is an alcove
faced with the original mirrors and containing a
basin set in beautiful inlaid work of black and
white marble. This, however, is covered up with
a wooden plate, which conceals the marble.</p>

<p>At the time of these alterations there was some
talk of removing the railings in the cloisters, which
are of Sussex iron, and reviving an inner walk,
traces of which have been discovered round the
edge of the grass. On the tower side the railings
have already gone&mdash;the remainder, let us hope,
will be left untouched. A great feature of the
cloisters is the old Cloister Pump, which, as in
the days when a less luxurious race of Collegers
washed at its spout, continues to yield the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
water in Eton. This old pump is associated with
the cry of “Cloister P!” at which the lowest boy
present had to fetch a canful of the sacred water,
the cry which sent every fag in Long Chamber
tearing down Sixth-Form passage. Not very far
away is the well-worn stone staircase up which so
many generations of Collegers have made their way
into the Hall, which, in spite of renovation, still
retains a certain amount of interest for those fond
of relics of another age.</p>

<p>A considerable portion of the existing structure
dates from about 1450, and to some extent follows
the design favoured by King Henry VI. The
founder’s original idea, however, was that a northern
bay window should face the southern one. He
also contemplated a porch with a tower over it.
One must be thankful that at the restoration of
1858 the College authorities did not attempt to
carry out these plans.</p>

<p>The early architectural history of the Hall is
somewhat puzzling. For some undiscovered reason
it was begun in stone and finished in brick, whilst
three large fireplaces were constructed but never
used, being covered with panelling till the so-called
restoration of the last century. In 1721 some
alterations were carried out according to the plan
of a Mr. Rowland, but from that time till 1858 the
Hall remained as it is shown in the <a href="#Fig_164">illustration
facing page 164</a>. At that date, however, the
Rev. Mr. Wilder, the Fellow who had contributed
so liberally to the modernisation of the interior of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the College Chapel, turned his attention to the old
building, which was restored at his expense. It
is to be regretted that a good deal of Renaissance
work of historical interest then disappeared,
retaining some features of the original design
constructed in its place.</p>

<p>For some unexplained reason (apparently it was
in fair repair) the old roof was destroyed, and a
new one substituted. The simple three-light
Renaissance west window, with a curious ornamented
ledge beneath, gave way to an elaborate
Gothic window, filled with stained glass representing
the very “apocryphal” story of Henry VII.’s
Eton days. Beneath this was erected an elaborate
screen of panelling, decorated with the arms of successive
provosts. The rest of the old panelling was
allowed to remain, though, owing to a very thorough
process of renovation, a great proportion of the
present woodwork is modern. Along the top of the
panelling may still be seen a number of old nails.
From these, according to an old Eton custom,
Collegers at Shrovetide used to hang scrolls of
Bacchus verses which were suspended by coloured
ribbons. These Bacchus verses, written in praise
or abuse of the jovial deity, continued to be
written in the earlier portion of the last century,
though by that time their character had changed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BACCHUS VERSES</div>

<p>The art of verse-writing was held in the
highest esteem at Eton, and was, together with
accurate prosody, the road to distinction. False
quantities were considered crimes. In the <cite>Etonian</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Praed had some clever lines as to this in his poem,
“The Eve of Battle”:&mdash;</p>

<p>A copy of Bacchus verses composed by Porson
on the subject of Cyrus exulting over captive
Babylon is preserved in the library. Pepys noted
these Bacchus verses in 1666:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To the Hall, and there find the boys’ verses, “De Peste,”
it being their custom to make verses at Shrovetide. I read
several, and very good they were, better, I think, than ever
I made when I was a boy, and in rolls as long, or longer,
than the whole Hall by much. Here is a picture of
Venice hung up, and a monument made by Sir H. Wotton’s
giving it to the College.</p></blockquote>

<p>This picture was moved many years ago, and
now hangs in Election Hall. Beneath it is the
following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Henricus Wottonius post tres apud Venetos Legationes
ordinarias in Etonensis Collegii beato sinu senescens, eiusque
cum suavissima inter Se Sociosque concordia annos iam XII.
Praefectus Hanc miram Vrbis quasi natantis effigiem in
aliquam sui memoriam iuxta Socialem Mensam affixit,
1636.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the picture itself may be seen the words,
“Opus Odoardus Fialettus, 1611.”</p>

<p>Near the oriel window there still stands the
iron reading-desk from which in old times a scholar
used to read out passages of Holy Writ. In early
days he appears to have been known as “the
Bibler.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">BURNT TAPESTRY</div>

<p>Before the restoration of the Hall two pieces of
tapestry given by a Fellow&mdash;Adam Robyns&mdash;in
1613 used to be hung beneath the west window at
Election time. They represented the flight into
Egypt and Christ teaching in the Temple. When
the Hall had been restored and the ornate modern
panelling or screen set up where this tapestry used
to hang, it was relegated to the bake-house. This
was burnt in 1875, and the tapestry, together with
the green rugs given to the Collegers by the Duke
of Cumberland in 1735, were utterly destroyed in
the conflagration. These rugs or coverlets were
edged with gold braid and embroidered with the
College arms.</p>

<div id="Fig_164" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">The College Hall before Restoration.<br />
<em>From an old print.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Up to the period of the modern alterations the
Hall was warmed by a circular charcoal brazier
standing beneath the louvre or opening in the roof.
In 1858, however, the three large fireplaces discovered
behind the panelling were taken into use;
they had never had chimneys before. Hot-water
pipes now also assist to warm the Hall.</p>

<p>On the walls hang some eighteen portraits, all
of Collegers except two, representing George III.
and Sir Thomas Smith. The Rev. John Wilder,
the well-meaning Fellow who spent such large
sums of money in altering and restoring Hall and
Chapel, is commemorated by a brass in the south-west
corner.</p>

<p>On the right in the Hall is a small table called
the “Servitor’s Desk.” The duty attached to the
old office of Servitor consists in noting down in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
book the commons allowed for each day’s dinner
according to the number actually dining in Hall.
He counts by “messes” and “half-messes,” a mess
consisting of four boys. It is the practice of most
Servitors to carve their name on the desk, and
among the names carved are those of A. C. Benson,
author and poet, and J. K. Stephen.</p>

<p>A few of the old customs are retained, the
authorities still sitting at the high table at the
west end. The Sixth Form sit at the first table
on the left side, carving their own joint; one of
them says Grace, shouting “Surgite! Benedicat
Deus” at the beginning of the meal, and “Surgite!
Benedicatur Deo” at the end, when the others
reply, “Deo Gratias.” On Sundays a Latin Grace
is chanted. The fare of Collegers formerly consisted
almost<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> exclusively of mutton, from which
arose the term “Tug-mutton,” and “Tug” applied
to a King’s scholar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“HARPY-PIES”</div>

<p>Within the last three decades three ancient
usages have been abandoned. The first of these
was “Bever,” which was abolished in 1890. “Bever”
consisted in a modest collation of bread and salt
and beer in “after fours” in the summer; Collegers
might partake of this if they wished, and were
allowed to invite guests. A second old usage
which disappeared about the same time was that of
certain boys receiving a double allowance of bread.
Though most of the old oak panelling of Hall was
replaced by new in 1858, amongst the old panels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
was one which for more than three hundred years
had proclaimed the privilege of the mess of four
boys which dined nearest to the door on the north
side of the Hall, “Queen Elizabethe ad nos gave
October x 2 loves in a mes 1596,” being roughly
inscribed upon it. Commemorating the munificence
of the virgin Queen for more than three
hundred years, two loaves, instead of the customary
one loaf, were set before the four boys sitting near
the panel. This practice has now been ended.
The third old custom was of a far less pleasant
character, and its disappearance is not to be
deplored. Formerly, after the Collegers had
dined, a number of old almswomen were allowed
to collect the remains, and in consequence the
Hall was at certain times thronged with a mass of
old women thrusting chunks of bread and scraps
of broken meat into bags. The whole thing was
a somewhat unseemly scramble. The boys were
often not very well disposed to the harpies, as they
called the old ladies, and would wickedly make
them what were known as “hag-traps” and “harpy-pies.”
The composition of these was a masterpiece
of diabolical ingenuity. A large square piece of
bread or quarter loaf having had its centre hollowed
out by means of a hole in the side, the interior was
cunningly filled with an unsavoury mixture of
mustard, pepper, cayenne, and whatever else came
to hand, after which the opening was cleverly
closed so that the bread might present a totally
unsuspicious appearance and then left lying about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
amongst genuine loaves. Though the old ladies
had considerable experience of various disagreeable
forms of College humour, this wicked device always
secured a certain amount of success. At the
present time the female pensioners are given a
small monetary allowance in place of being allowed
to enter the Hall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN UNAPPRECIATED POET</div>

<p>The Upper School occupies the whole of the
west side of the school-yard, with the exception of
the space covered by the headmaster’s room at the
north end. It was originally built by Provost
Allestree, but so faultily that it had to be rebuilt
under his successor, Provost Cradock, in 1694.
Though by some attributed to him, the architect
was probably not Sir Christopher Wren; yet
the style adopted, very different from that of
the other buildings in the school-yard, is that
associated with his name. Though now only rarely
used, Upper School was formerly the principal
class-room of Eton, and at the beginning of the
nineteenth century no less than 400 boys were
taught there at the same time. The ground floor
beneath is now occupied by rooms which in the
last century were considered quite good enough
to accommodate large “divisions,” but have now
been turned into a “school office,” a porter’s lodge,
and store-rooms of various kinds. On the floor
above is the “Upper School” itself, approached at
the south end by a fine staircase&mdash;a well-proportioned
room, lined with oak panelling which has
served for the recording of many Eton names, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
adorned with the busts of Etonians who have
served their country. The first of these busts was
put up in 1840, when the Marquess Wellesley
presented his to the school&mdash;his brother, the Duke
of Wellington, shortly afterwards following his
example. Most of the great Etonians are here,
including Shelley. It is said that when the idea
of erecting the poet’s bust was first mooted, Dr.
Hornby objected, saying that Shelley was a bad
man, and he only wished he had been educated at
Harrow. The memory of this poet&mdash;in former
days, at least&mdash;was not held in any particular
respect by the vast majority of Etonians, most of
whom held much the same views about him as
have been attributed to Dr. Hornby.</p>

<p>Some thirty years ago, when the subject of
the amenities of Eton was being discussed by
a House Debating Society, an Upper boy&mdash;now
a well-known Peer&mdash;brought the debate to a close
with a breezy speech. Eton, he said, was in his
opinion a very good place; all boys were happy
there, or ought to be. As far as he could make
out, all boys always had been happy there, and
he had only heard of one who wasn’t, and that
was “a boy called Shelley, who was a mad fool.”
He then sat down amidst applause.</p>

<p>An immense quantity of names are cut on the
woodwork of Upper School. Most of these are
those of boys who became famous in after life.
The name of Charles James Fox, for instance, is
to be seen beneath his bust. Gladstone’s may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
easily be recognised among a number of other
names of the same family by the fact that there
was not sufficient room left for the whole name,
and consequently the last three letters are cut
much smaller than the rest. Lord Roberts’s name
is on the large south door, and Shelley’s under
Lord Wellesley’s bust, to the right, and again high
up, to the left, beneath his own bust. Gladstone’s
name, it should be added, is on the upper right-hand
panel of the door which stands to the left
as you face the Headmaster’s desk in the Upper
School. His sons have their names cut on the
same door close by. This carving was not done
by Gladstone himself, but by Dr. Keate’s servant
in requital for a fee. Originally boys, before leaving,
cut their names where they liked in Upper
School. Later on, as in the writer’s time, it was
the custom on leaving to present the Headmaster’s
servant with a guinea to have this done. The
present practice seems to be that for half a guinea
a specially appointed official cuts a boy’s name.
Close to Upper School, on the top of the staircase
leading to the Headmaster’s room, may be seen the
name Lord Dalmeny cut twice on the left, opposite
the door; the older is that of Lord Rosebery, the
newer that of his son.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOWER SCHOOL</div>

<p>The original Eton schoolroom was the present
Lower School, which happily remains practically in
its original state. The exact date of its erection is
uncertain, but it would appear to have been built
somewhere about the end of the fourteenth century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
According to an old tradition Lower School was
once the College stables, and it was Sir Henry
Wotton who, when Provost, fitted it up with
pillars, on which he is supposed to have painted
pictures of Greek and Roman authors for the
instruction of the boys. This quaint old room was
formerly open for its full length, and looked very
picturesque with its double row of oaken pillars
supporting the floor of the chamber above, and
deeply recessed windows, the oaken shutters, as
well as the pillars, graven with the names of former
Etonians. For two centuries it was the only
schoolroom. In recent times, for convenience of
teaching, it has been turned into three rooms by
means of deal partitions. These, however, being
merely temporary erections, have not injured the
ancient fabric of the room. Many generations of
boys have amused themselves by poking pens and
knives into the deep chinks of the pillars and
spearing out bits of paper that had been thrust in
there by boys of bygone times. Mr. Brinsley
Richards has described how, as a boy at Eton, he
extracted the fragment of a play-bill, issued by a
strolling troupe who performed at Windsor Fair in
1769. In the writer’s day many a boy, unconsciously
imbued with that love of sending messages
to posterity which is such a characteristic of youth,
would write his name upon a scrap of paper and
poke it deep into a hole or cranny.</p>

<p>Numerous names carved on the shutters and
pillars of this room are striking links with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
remote past. The names in question, it would
appear, are in the vast majority of instances those
of Collegers elected from Eton to King’s. They
begin on the westernmost window on the north
side, the earliest name discoverable being that of
Kemp, 1577, somewhere about the middle of the
shutter. On the first shutter on the left-hand side
of the third room is the mark of a name which has
been erased. This is supposed to have been that
of Greenhall, who, leaving King’s College, became
a highwayman and was captured, hanged, and
dissected.</p>

<p>Samuel Pepys, who visited Eton in 1666, was
very pleased with Lower School. This favourable
impression is recorded in his diary:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All mighty fine. The School good, and the custom
pretty of boys cutting their names in the shuts of the
window when they go to Cambridge, by which many a one
hath lived to see himself a Provost and Fellow, that hath his
name in the window standing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Over Lower School was the ancient “Long
Chamber,” now turned into the junior Collegers’
dormitory. It once extended the whole length of
the school-yard, with the exception of the space
occupied by the Headmaster’s chamber at the west
end, and that of the Lower Master at the east.
Its length was considerably lessened in 1844, and
since that time it has been divided by partitions
into “stalls” or “cubicles,” so that little of the
original appearance of the interior remains.</p>

<p>When Long Chamber was broken up into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
cubicles, old Plumtre, one of the Fellows, preached
a sermon on the text, “And Elisha said, Let
every man take unto himself a beam, for the place
we have made is too strait for us.” Plumtre was
a staunch old Tory, who hated the Reform Bill.
For one whole night he walked round and round
the Eton cloisters, praying and waiting for the
expected news of its defeat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CHAPEL</div>

<p>The Eton College Chapel was built in 1441, the
foundation-stone being laid by King Henry VI. in
person on Passion Sunday of that year. It was
finished by Waynflete, who was Eton’s benefactor
till his death in 1484. Owing no doubt to lack of
means, the latter curtailed the original design, which
provided for a nave 168 feet long stretching down
what is now Keate’s Lane and finished the building
with the Ante-Chapel, which still remains. A
wooden rood-loft was erected over the chancel
arch, with a crucifix between wooden figures of
St. Mary and St. John, whilst stalls and frescoes,
ordered to be wiped out in 1560, completed an
interior which must have been beautiful and
picturesque. Lupton’s Chapel, in which is Provost
Lupton’s brass, was built by him in 1515. Here is
now the tablet giving the names of those who fell
in the South African War.</p>

<p>At the time of the Reformation there was
naturally a good deal of iconoclastic destruction,
and at the end of the seventeenth century the
Chapel had suffered severely from dilapidation and
neglect. In 1699-1700, under Provost Godolphin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
however, a general remodelling of the Chapel had
been undertaken, it would seem probable, under
the direction of Wren. In the course of the
alterations the floor would appear to have been
raised, whilst the walls were covered nearly up to
the windows with panelling of simple though good
design. A classical organ-loft with fine decorative
carving was at that time placed across the choir
near the second window from the west end.</p>

<p>During the eighteenth century the interior of
the Eton Chapel evoked nothing but praise, but
with the mania for restoration which characterised
the Victorian era, some desire for drastic alterations
began to make itself felt. Whilst the
general appearance of the Chapel was dignified
and stately, there were undoubtedly certain disfigurements,
the chief amongst them two great
box-like pews at the east end, specially allotted
to the male and female College servants. An
elaborate altar-piece of inlaid wood, entirely concealing
the east end, though good of its kind,
was somewhat heavy and out of place. Good
or bad, however, all the woodwork was soon to
disappear.</p>

<p>In 1842, when the so-called Gothic revival first
began to sweep over England, destroying much
worthy to be preserved and creating comparatively
little of artistic merit, it was determined to
restore the Chapel. At first this was limited to
tearing down the classical altar-piece, pews, and
panelling at the east end and erecting ponderous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
so-called Gothic altar rails, pulpit, and the like, all
of stone. These, however, were discarded a few
years later, when, in 1847, a regular scheme of
destruction and innovation was undertaken by
Deeson, one of whose chief artistic crimes was
tearing down the noblemen’s stalls, then standing
against the walls at the western end. Up to the
so-called restoration of 1847, boys who were
noblemen or baronets used to occupy special
seats of honour ranged along the Chapel walls.
When one of these privileged youths&mdash;known as
“Nobs”&mdash;first took his seat in one of these stalls
he would, according to immemorial custom, distribute
amongst his neighbours small packets of
almonds and raisins, called “Chapel sock,” which
were eaten in the Chapel itself. These seats, finely
designed with carving at the top, were ruthlessly
torn down, whilst no exact record of their appearance
was preserved. A considerable portion of the
panelling, which formerly covered the east end,
adorns the hall at Frampton Park, Dorchester, but
the writer has been unable to trace the noblemen’s
seats which were swept away to make room for the
present stalls.</p>

<p>The behaviour of the College authorities in
having discarded work of high artistic interest,
probably designed by Wren, is much to be deplored.
The evidence as to Wren having designed
the panelling is not absolutely conclusive, but much
leads one to think that he was concerned in its
design. The Mr. Banks, “surveyor,” whose name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
has been preserved as the designer of the costly
woodwork, is probably identical with Matthew
Bankes, “master carpenter,” who, under Wren’s
direction, carried out the interior decoration and
fitting of Kensington Palace, Hampton Court,
and other historical buildings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE OLD ORGAN CASE</div>

<p>The huge organ-loft, about twenty-five feet in
depth, was approached by a flight of steps, which
Provost Godolphin placed across the church within
the choir. This loft or screen was a very fine piece
of work, with fluted columns of oak, two of which
are preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum,
and elaborate carving, by Grinling Gibbons,
much resembling the one which still remains at
Trinity College, Cambridge. The organ-case,
which, curiously enough, has hitherto escaped all
detailed notice in books about Eton, was of oak,
and consisted of four towers and three flats
of pipes&mdash;the pipe shades, lower frieze scrolls, side
brackets and centre shield of arms being beautifully
carved and well designed, while characteristically
English in style. Above was a scroll
ending in a point, for the carving of which
Bird (who executed much fine woodwork under
the direction of Sir Christopher Wren) was paid
£24 in 1703. The organ itself, built by either
William Smith or Father Smith, was erected in
1700, and cost a large sum of money for that day.
This organ and its beautiful case is specially
mentioned in <cite>Organ-Cases and Organs of the
Middle Ages and Renaissance</cite>, the erudite and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
artistic work written and illustrated by the
greatest English authority on the subject, Mr.
A. G. Hill, who speaks of the old Eton College
organ as being perhaps the best of all similar
organs still remaining in England. It may be
mentioned that the example formerly at Whitehall,
and now in St. Peter’s Church at the Tower of
London, much resembles it. After the Eton Chapel
restoration of 1844-1847 this old organ, with its
beautiful case, was discarded in order to make
way for a new one which was placed half-way
up the choir on the south side. No one seems
to have thought the old organ worth preserving,
and the case was eventually found by a member
of the famous organ-building firm of Hill, lying
about in bits in the yard of those who had taken
it down. Mr. Hill at once recognised the high
artistic value of the magnificent woodwork, and,
after the various portions of the case had been
fitted together, adapted it to a new organ, which
passed into the possession of the late Mr. Josiah
Spode, of Hawkesyard Park, Rugeley, who put
it up in his hall. Mr. Spode left his property
to his niece, with a proviso that at her death a
certain portion should be applied to founding a
monastery. This lady, however, preferred to
carry out this wish during her own lifetime, and,
expending a far larger sum than was stipulated
by the will, founded at Rugeley the Dominican
Monastery of St. Thomas, in the beautiful chapel
of which the old Eton organ-case was put up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
In connection with its history it is curious to
recall that this splendid specimen of Jacobean
woodwork was thrown out of the Eton Chapel
because it was supposed to be “out of place”
in a Gothic building. The Chapel at Rugeley is
a singularly successful example of modern Gothic
at its best, and the organ-case accords perfectly
with its surroundings. A feature of the old
case, adorned with scrolls and carvings lovingly
wrought by the hand of a master craftsman of
a past age, is its heraldic embellishment, the
ornamentation including three shields bearing
coats of arms. The large central one at the
top shows the Royal arms of England, enriched
by the legend “Honi soit qui mal y pense.”
The smaller left-hand shield in the hands of
an angel at the bottom of the case bears the
familiar arms of Eton, whilst another on the right-hand
side shows those of the sister foundation of
King’s.</p>

<p>After the Eton authorities had cleared their
Chapel of all the old Jacobean woodwork, they
turned their attention to the roof, it being at
first proposed to construct a new one of stone.
Happily, however, fear of the Chapel collapsing
checked such a scheme, and the architect, Deeson,
merely stripped the paint and plaster from the
roof, whilst adding some pseudo-Gothic cusping.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A RUTHLESS RESTORATION</div>

<p>The interior of the Chapel as it appeared before
1700 in no wise resembled that which we at present
see. Mural monuments abounded about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
chancel; these, after being concealed by the
wainscoting put up in 1700, were ruthlessly torn
from their places by those responsible for the
restoration of 1847. Some of them are in the
Ante-Chapel, others were totally swept away. In
the original Chapel there were probably only
benches at the east end, whilst low wooden
stalls with miserere seats occupied the place of
the present seats crowned by canopies. The
only remnants of the ancient woodwork appear
to be some old wooden forms in the Ante-Chapel,
on which boys now leave their hats. It is recorded
that in 1625 Thomas Weaver, a “Fellow,”
gave “four strong forms to stand in the aisles
of the Church for the townsmen to sit on.” The
seats in question, it should be added, seem originally
to have been intended for the townspeople
of Eton, who then attended the Chapel as their
parish church.</p>

<em>Engraved by D. Havell after E. Mackenzie.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Above the low stalls were paintings, and these
in 1560 the College barber was ordered to wash
out; his account for the work (6s. 8d.) is still
extant. The barber, however, merely covered up
the designs with white paint or whitewash, and
when the fine old stalls were removed the paintings
could be clearly seen upon the wall behind. In
1847, however, in order to produce a surface capable
of showing up the canopies of the new stalls then
in course of erection, the workmen proceeded
to scrape out all trace of the ancient designs, and
they had already finished this work of destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
at the top of the walls beneath the string-courses
when a Fellow of the College, chancing to stroll
in to inspect the work, saved the rest, some of
which still remains behind the modern panelling,
of which the Eton authorities have certainly very
little reason to be proud. After the discovery
there was for a time some idea of leaving the
paintings exposed to view, or at least contriving
an arrangement of sliding panels. Provost Hodgson,
however, objected to them as being “superstitious,”
and they were consequently permanently
covered by the present panelling. The designs,
which were fortunately sketched before being
covered up, have been described as the finest of
the kind ever discovered in England. They were
in all probability the work of some Florentine
artist of the fifteenth century. Each row of
paintings was divided longitudinally into seventeen
compartments, alternately wide and narrow. Concerning
these Sir Maxwell Lyte, in his excellent
history of the College, writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The former contained historical compositions, the latter
single figures of Saints represented as standing in canopied
niches. Most of these Saints may be identified by their
emblems. Under each of the large compartments there was
a Latin inscription, explaining the subject of the picture,
and giving a reference to the book whence its story was
derived. The works most frequently quoted were the
<cite>Legenda Sanctorum</cite> and Vincent of Beauvais’ <cite>Speculum
Historiale</cite>, one of the earliest productions of the printing-press,
which had already gone through three editions before
1479. According to a practice which prevailed extensively
in the fifteenth century, successive incidents of a story were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
often represented as forming only one scene, the same figure
appearing two or three times in different combinations. The
whole series was intended to exemplify the gracious protection
afforded by the Blessed Virgin, the Patroness of the
College, to her votaries in all ages and countries. No less
than six of the compartments were occupied by scenes from
the life of a mythical Roman Empress.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">GROSS VANDALISM</div>

<p>From first to last the so-called restoration cost
over £20,000, £5000 of which was contributed
by Mr. Wilder. In reality it was no restoration
at all&mdash;merely a terrible act of vandalism,
only exceeded in lack of taste by the alterations
carried out at the sister college of Winchester
some thirty years later, when all the priceless
woodwork was removed from the chapel. Within
recent years this was sold for an enormous sum,
and is now at Hursley Park, not many miles away
from the College which it once adorned.</p>

<p>Besides the tearing down of the fine old panelling
and the partial destruction of ancient frescoes,
in all probability a quantity of other interesting
old work was destroyed at the orgy of iconoclasm
in 1847. The only object of those in power at
Eton at that time seems to have been to destroy
everything which recalled the past. They gloried
in the havoc they wrought within the Chapel, and
in their “restoring fervour” actually went so far as
to tear up the black and white marble pavement.
It is to be hoped that some day this may be
replaced. Would that some portion of the fine
old woodwork might be recovered and once again
find a place in the sacred edifice where for close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
upon a hundred and fifty years it met the eyes
of generations of Etonians!</p>

<p>In place of the stately old noblemen’s seats put
up in 1700, Deeson designed seventy oak stalls with
carved canopies of modern Gothic design. Each
canopy seems to have cost £42, which, considering
that the artistic value of the stalls is exactly nil, is
a large sum. It would be interesting to know
what the value of the noblemen’s stalls which
Deeson tore down would be at the present time!</p>

<p>Entering the Chapel through the screen, the first
of the canopied stalls on the right is that occupied
by the Provost, that on the left by the Vice-Provost.
The second stall on the right was given
by the Fellows of King’s College, the third by
Winchester College, and the fourth by the President
and Fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford,
like Eton connected with the memory of Waynflete.
The Headmaster’s stall is the seventeenth on the
right, distinguished by the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magister Informator</i>.
Exactly opposite is the seat of the
Lower master (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ostiarius</i>), who, however, usually
attends Lower Chapel. A number of the stalls
given by Etonians or Etonian families have tablets
with inscriptions. Next but two to the Lower
master, for instance, is a stall given by the Cust
family, of whom some eight generations have
been educated at Eton. Beneath the seat is to be
found the genealogy of all the Custs who have
been at the school. The twenty-sixth stall on
either side are those of the chaplains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Capellani
Conductitii</i>), known as “Conducts” at Eton. The
last stall but one on the left was given by James
Rattee, the contractor for the stalls, and the one
opposite by Deeson, the architect, who no doubt
thought that his imitation Gothic was vastly
superior to the stately work which he treated with
such contempt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MACHINE-MADE GOTHIC</div>

<p>Most of the alterations in the Eton Chapel were
lamentable in the extreme. Nevertheless they
excited great admiration amongst many who had
sat there in its unrestored days. Apparently they
were quite satisfied that the fine old panelling, in all
probability designed by Wren, should be removed.
One of these lovers of novelty wrote: “Those
who only know the Chapel in its present nobly
restored state could with difficulty go back to the
simply glazed windows, bare walls, and cold cheerless
aspect of the whole interior in former times.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
How such a “noble restoration” (consisting in the
destruction of every vestige of ancient woodwork
in order to substitute a quantity of machine-made-looking
Gothic stalls and some poor cusping to
the roof) can have moved any one to enthusiasm it
is almost impossible to understand. Nor can the
crudely coloured stained-glass windows be said to
be a great improvement upon the old plain glass,
which at least caused no pain to the eye.</p>

<p>The true and artistic restoration would have
been to have retained the old stalls against the
western walls, while contriving a method by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
portions of it could be temporarily removed in
order to afford a view of the frescoes. The high
box-like pews might have been modified, the old
woodwork being utilised to the utmost extent, or
at least preserved for use in other parts of the
College. If the position of the stately old organ-loft
opposite the second window of the west end
was found to be absolutely unsuited to modern
requirements, together with its wooden pilasters
of admirable design, it might have been re-erected
at the junction of the choir with the Ante-Chapel,
the stalls being continued farther back. As for
the magnificent organ-case, there would have been
no difficulty, as has been proved at Rugeley,
about furnishing it with a modern interior and
new pipes. The roof should have merely been
freed from paint, etc., and not been adorned with
the meaningless cusping, which, never contemplated
by its original designer, is so obviously out of place.</p>

<p>The present organ-screen, erected in 1882 by
Mr. G. E. Street in memory of Etonians who
fell in the Zulu, Afghan, and Boer wars of 1879,
1880, and 1881, cannot be called a masterpiece of
architectural design, but in certain other respects
the interior of the Chapel has been somewhat
improved within recent years. An elaborately
designed floor of black and white marble has
been laid down at the east end. This, together
with a handsome if not altogether appropriate
altar, forms part of the memorial to the Etonians
who fell in the South African War (1899-1902).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
As stated before, the names of those who died
for their country in this deplorable contest are
inscribed upon a roll of honour in Lupton Chapel.</p>

<p>The fine tapestry behind the altar, executed by
the firm of William Morris from the designs of the
late Sir Edward Burne-Jones, was presented by an
art-loving Eton Master, Mr. H. E. Luxmoore, in
1895, whilst the picture of Sir Galahad, hanging
on the western wall, was presented by its painter,
Watts.</p>

<p>The great stained-glass east window&mdash;a source
of grumbling and discontent to several generations
of Etonians, who were obliged to contribute what
was known as “window-money”&mdash;was executed by
Willement between 1844 and 1849, being set up in
bits as the contributions wrung from the boys increased.
Within recent years the crude and violent
tints of this costly example of the work of a bad
period have been softened. The irregular curve of
the external arch-mould over this window is said to
be due to the circumstance that when the College
Chapel was built the stones of the Parish Church
(which stood in the present graveyard and was
built in 1441) were used over again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A TRANSPARENT FAILURE</div>

<p>If the great east window is now somewhat less
of a “transparent failure” than of yore, the other
windows on the north and south sides of the Chapel
remain specimens of bad design and colour. Those
in the Ante-Chapel, however, are less glaring. The
two large windows by Hardman on the north and
south form the memorial to Etonians who fell in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the Crimea; those at the west end are personal
memorials. Below these windows are a number of
tablets commemorating Etonians of note. On
the floor of the Ante-Chapel is a fine slab to the
memory of the late Bishop Abraham. There is
also a marble statue of the Founder, by Durham,
and another of Provost Goodall, who in all
probability would have been appalled by the
changes of 1847.</p>

<p>The Rev. John Wilder, whose munificence
served to modernise the College Chapel he had
known all his life, is also here commemorated by
a tablet. Besides giving £5000 to the restoration
fund, he presented fourteen stained-glass windows
in the choir, and decorated the reredos and east
end as well as the new organ and case. Though
his benefactions were animated by a generous and
unselfish spirit, it is much to be regretted that
he did not devote his money to some better
purpose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LOST FONT</div>

<p>In the Ante-Chapel, behind a railing, is a font,
placed there at the time of the renovations sixty
years ago. It was presented by some Collegers as
a memorial to C. J. Abraham. The last baptism
for which it was used took place two or three
years ago, when an Eton boy of fourteen or fifteen
was christened in the Chapel. About to be confirmed,
it was discovered that he had never been
baptized. In all probability he was a foreigner.
There stood previously at the same place an older
font, of which there is mention as early as 1479.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Lipscomb describes the earlier one as “a beautiful
ancient font of white marble, of an octagon shape,
elegantly carved in relief and supported by a
pedestal on a square plinth.” It would be interesting
to know what has become of this font. If
not broken up, it has probably been sent away to
some village church.</p>

<p>In the Ante-Chapel, before the Reformation,
there existed four altars, the chief of which, still
marked by a row of niches, was in the south-eastern
corner behind where now stands the statue
of Provost Goodall. This was called the Altar of
St. Catherine, or sometimes the Altar of Thomas
Jourdelay, after a certain inhabitant of Eton who
lies buried near it. Provost Bost (1477-1504) left
a sum of money for an extra chaplain who should
say Mass at this altar at least three times a week
for him and his relations. The altar in the north-eastern
corner of the Ante-Chapel was dedicated to
the Blessed Virgin. The remaining two were on
either side of the entrance to the choir and were
dedicated to St. Nicholas and St. Peter.</p>

<p>One of the few relics which the spirit of change
has left intact in this old Chapel is the lectern,
which within recent years has once more been taken
into use. It dates from the fifteenth century, and
escaped destruction by the Puritans in 1651, when
the College paid sixpence for its removal. A
considerable number of Etonians are fittingly
commemorated in the Chapel, but the Marquis
Wellesley, in all probability the greatest lover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of Eton who ever lived, has his memorial in the
North Porch, where may be seen the Latin elegiacs
which he wrote as his own epitaph. The tablet
on which they are inscribed was erected by his
brother, the great Duke. A good rendering in
English verse was made by Lord Derby:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentbase">Long tost on Fortune’s waves, I come to rest,
</div><div class="indentbase">Eton, once more on thy maternal breast.
</div><div class="indentbase">On loftiest deeds to fix the aspiring gaze,
</div><div class="indentbase">To seek the purer lights of ancient days,
</div><div class="indentbase">To love the simple paths of manly truth,&mdash;
</div><div class="indentbase">These were the lessons of my opening youth.
</div><div class="indentbase">If on my later life some glory shine,
</div><div class="indentbase">Some honours grace my name, the meed is thine.
</div><div class="indentbase">My boyhood’s nurse, my aged dust receive,
</div><div class="indentbase">And one last tear of kind remembrance give!
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Lord Wellesley was deeply attached to his old
school, and some of the last productions of his
pen were dedicated to Eton. Consequently it
was only fitting that when he died, in testimony
of the strong affection which he entertained
towards the place where he received his first
impressions of literary taste, and in accordance
with his desire expressed before his death, his
body should be laid to rest beneath the College
Chapel of Eton&mdash;that spot of earth which, through
a long and arduous life in many lands, was ever
the nearest and dearest to his heart. The new
Lower Chapel, built 1889-1891, also contains a
memorial to Lord Wellesley in a stained-glass
window, the gift of the late Mr. A. Montgomery,
who was once his private secretary.</p>

<p>Two Eton Headmasters are commemorated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
monuments on the right towards the eastern end
of the Chapel. These are Dr. Balston and Dr.
Hawtrey, the last person to be buried within the
Chapel walls. On his breast is a badge with the
arms of Scotland and the motto <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nemo me impune
lacessit</i> just showing. This badge recalls an old
Eton usage<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> now extinct. The most modern
monument is a statue of Henry VI., put up over
the north door to the memory of the late Mr.
J. P. Carter, for many years one of the Assistant
Masters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PINNACLES&mdash;OLD AND NEW</div>

<p>In 1876, owing to much of the Headington
stone used by Waynflete having become decayed,
the whole of the exterior of the Ante-Chapel was
entirely refaced.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> This, with other restorations,
of necessity impaired a good deal of its ancient
charm. On the whole the renovation was carried
out with care, but it is to be regretted that the
old pinnacles were then entirely removed and new
ones (designed in a highly ornate style of Gothic
for which there is no authority<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>) erected under
the direction of Mr. Woodyer. The old pinnacles
had last been repaired in 1698-1699. A curious
circumstance connected with them is that during
their removal fragments of the ancient reredos&mdash;destroyed
in 1546-1548&mdash;were discovered to have
been built into their fabric. Whatever may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
have been the demerits of the old pinnacles, one
or two of them which had suffered least from
the hands of time should have been allowed to
remain in place, so that future generations might
realise the original design which modern taste, or
lack of taste, has chosen to discard.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting architectural
features of the College Chapel is the ancient holy
water stoup on the right-hand side of the door of
the south porch. As may be seen in old prints,
the service bell was formerly in a sort of dovecot
(irreverently called by some a larder) placed
on the roof of the porch. Here also hung the
knell bell, which, as long as the College Chapel
remained the Eton Parish Church, was tolled for
all funerals. The service bell still in use, hanging
in the turret at the south-western angle, bears the
inscription “Prayes Ye Lord, 1637.”</p>

<p>In a niche on the west wall of the Ante-Chapel,
facing the street, a statue of William Waynflete
was placed in 1893. This was subscribed for by
some old Etonians connected with Sussex. The
task of designing it was entrusted to Sir Arthur
Blomfield, who produced one of the very few bits
of commendable modern work in Eton. Indeed,
this little statue, beneath an elaborate canopy, may
be called the only real artistic improvement carried
out within the last seventy years, during which
time so much labour and money have been devoted
to what in some cases amounts to mere wanton
destruction. Of the new quadrangle and Lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Chapel, built by Sir Arthur Blomfield 1889-1891,
little need here be said. On the whole, the architect
has done his work well, and no doubt, under
the mellowing influence of time, the Queen’s schools
will assume something of that picturesque aspect
which in some slight degree already pertains to
the New Schools completed by Mr. Woodyer in
1863.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOWER CHAPEL</div>

<p>A full account of the new Lower Chapel, its
memorials and stained-glass windows, is to be
found in the admirable <cite>Illustrated Guide to Eton
College</cite> written by Mr. R. A. Austen Leigh,
who in this and other works has done much
which should gain for him the thanks of all
Etonians. Since the construction of the New
Schools, Upper School, which tradition has connected
with the name of Wren, is only used as
a schoolroom for one division for the purposes
of examination. Speeches, I believe, are now
to take place in the new Memorial Hall, and the
busts of celebrated Etonians will no longer look
down upon the visitors who flock to Eton on
the 4th of June. The old staircase, from the
colonnade to Upper School, is one of the most
picturesque portions of the College. Here it was
that in old days boys promoted from Lower to
Upper School were subjected to the ordeal of
“booking,” being hit on the head with books as
they passed up the staircase.</p>

<p>Within the last fifty years the town of Eton
has suffered severely from a picturesque point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
view owing to the demolition and alteration of
many quaint old houses which formerly gave the
place a charming old-world appearance. The
“Old Sun,” which was pulled down not very long
ago, contained some fine arched oaken beams, and
the laths were perpendicular and fastened with
willow twigs. On the front wall used to be a Sun
Insurance plate of the eighteenth century, one of
the earliest issued by that Company.</p>

<p>In that part of Eton given up to houses for
boys, alterations have of necessity been made
in order to afford accommodation for increased
numbers. Some of the older houses have had
extra stories added, whilst entirely new ones
have also been built. Of these latter somewhat
“barracky” erections it is perhaps best not to
speak.</p>

<p>With regard to the Eton Memorial, however,
built for some unknown reason in the Renaissance
style, the writer can only say that in his opinion a
building less in keeping with the spirit of Eton it
would have been impossible to erect. Why the
authorities should have selected a design of this
sort is difficult to understand. Surely some
architect might have been found to produce a
building which would have harmonised with the fine
old brickwork which in the quadrangle and elsewhere
produces such a charming effect? To intrude
a purely personal opinion, those responsible
for the maintenance of Eton School have within
the last seventy years committed three great artistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
mistakes&mdash;the first, the indiscriminating restoration
of the College Chapel, entailing the destruction
of much admirable woodwork; the second, the
renovation of the College Hall, in which it is
admitted a number of interesting features were
obliterated; the third, the erection of the huge
Memorial, the whole aspect and style of which
is utterly out of keeping with its surroundings.</p>

<p>Closely associated with Eton is the adjoining
Royal Borough of Windsor, in which past generations
of Etonians played so many wild pranks.
The houses which formerly fringed the walls of
the Castle have long disappeared, and on the
other side of the road few ancient buildings remain.
The queer old theatre and gabled buildings near
“Damnation Corner” have been demolished within
comparatively recent years. “Damnation Corner,”
it is curious to recall, received its name from the
fact that in the old “shirking” days it was extremely
difficult for an Eton boy to avoid a master
coming quickly round the corner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MONSTROUS ROOF</div>

<p>During the last fifty years the whole appearance
of Windsor Hill has been transformed, the
hand of the restorer having not even spared
the venerable curfew tower&mdash;now for some forty-eight
years disfigured by a roof so monstrous in
its ugliness that it stands forth as a surpassing and
convincing proof of our national lack of artistic
taste.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FUTILE PRATTLE</div>

<p>The hideous top, totally inappropriate in style,
was put up by Salvin in 1863, when the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
bell tower of picturesque and suitable appearance
was demolished. The operations carried
out at that date were, of course, dignified by
the name of “restoration”; as a matter of fact the
unwieldy addition to the tower had not a vestige
of archæological authority. It is much to be
hoped that some day the ancient appearance of the
tower will be restored, for the huge, ugly, and
inappropriate slated roof constitutes an eyesore
from almost every point of vantage from which
the Castle can be viewed. Within quite recent
years there could be seen, looming through an
embrasure, the muzzle of an old cannon, which,
according to a local legend, had been placed there
by Cromwell in order to guard against any hostile
move from the direction of Eton. During a
recent visit to Windsor the writer was quite
unable to locate either cannon or embrasure; presumably
both have gone. This old curfew tower&mdash;the
oldest part of the Castle, and said to have
been built in the days of the Conqueror himself&mdash;has
been peculiarly unfortunate. When Salvin
constructed his abominable top he had the decency
to leave the rest of the external structure alone,
and in the writer’s Eton days, thirty years ago,
almost all the old stonework and quaint little
windows, cunningly contrived for bowmen to shoot
through, remained as they had been built. Since
then there have been two or three reparations; no
doubt the decay of the stone made some renovations
necessary. In the last of these, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
during which the whole of the exterior was refaced
with an entirely different kind of stone, the original
design of the tower, which, like all the work of the
Normans, was very simple, has been tampered with,
the result being that its ancient charm has been
completely impaired. So is it that in this country,
in spite of much meaningless gush and prattle of
education and appreciation of art, almost every fine
monument is by degrees vulgarised and destroyed.
The curfew tower, it should be added, was one
of the few parts of the Castle left untouched by
George IV. in the very comprehensive remodelling
of the whole stately pile by Wyattville.</p>

<h2>VII<br />
COLLEGE</h2>


<p>Till the carrying out of the reforms initiated by
Provost Hodgson in 1844 the treatment of the
King’s scholars constituted little short of a public
scandal, rendered the more iniquitous because
College was the original Eton, and the lack of
consideration and comfort shown to boys on the
Foundation was directly contrary to the wishes of
the Founder. No wonder was it that the number
of those in College often fell far short of the
appointed seventy, sometimes sinking as low as
thirty-eight. In one year there were but six candidates
for forty vacancies. The prospective advantages
which a Colleger might reasonably expect at
King’s College, Cambridge, were not enough to
counterbalance the discomfort and degradation of
existence in the great dormitory known as “Long
Chamber,” besides which the expenses of a King’s
scholar were little less than those of the well-fed
and comfortably housed Oppidan, the cost of
education on the Eton Foundation often falling
not very far short of a hundred a year&mdash;a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
extravagant outlay considering that a Colleger was
cared for no better than a charity boy.</p>

<div id="Fig_196" class="figcenter" style="width: 368px;">
<img src="images/i_p196.jpg" width="368" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A Colleger, 1816.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">“THESE POOR BOYS”</div>

<p>Glancing over the records of the treatment
meted out to those whom Provost Hodgson rightly
termed “these poor boys,” one wonders that the
masters, who were perfectly acquainted with the state
of affairs in College, made practically no protest.
It must be remembered, however, that at that time
all of them without exception had been Collegers
themselves, and having come through the ordeal
with comparative immunity from harm, probably
had some sort of idea that the hardships and discomforts
of life in College produced hardy and
successful men. What these hardships and discomforts
were may be realised from the view taken
by an Insurance Company as to chances of life of
any one who had undergone them. In 1826 Dr.
Okes, when applying for an insurance policy,
in reply to one of the questions put to him
stated that “he had slept in Long Chamber for
eight years,” on hearing which the chairman of the
Board said, “We needn’t ask Mr. Okes any more
questions.” Existence in the ill-kept and insanitary
dormitory in question was calculated to promote
only the survival of the fittest, and those
who grew up to be healthy men might well be
accounted “good lives.”</p>

<p>Whilst, as has been said, little protest was ever
raised at Eton itself against the deliberate misinterpretation
of the statutes with respect to the
scholars, public opinion gradually became aroused,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and many old Etonians, notwithstanding the intense
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> which has always been a characteristic
of the school, joined in the chorus of
unanimous reprobation which demanded reform.
About 1834 the Eton authorities were violating
not only the spirit but the letter of the ancient
statutes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BROKEN STATUTES</div>

<p>The statutes required that the fines and land-tax
should be applied to the common use (“ad
communem utilitatem”), instead of which they
were appropriated by the Provost and Fellows to
their own use.</p>

<p>The statutes entitled the Fellows to £10 a year
stipend, and 2s. a week, or £5, 4s. a year, for
commons, whereas they had increased their stipend
to £50 a year, and received in lieu of commons
on an average £550 a year each, or £10, 11s. 6d.
per week instead of 2s.</p>

<p>The statutes entitled the Provost and seven
Fellows to allowances amounting in all to £200
per annum, but in practice they received nearly
£7000.</p>

<p>The statutes required that the scholars should
be supplied with dress and bedding; with all, in
fact, “quae ad vestitum et lectisternia eorundem
aliaque iis necessaria pertinent.” Nevertheless,
with the exception of a coarse gown, the scholars
received nothing appertaining to dress from the
funds of the College.</p>

<p>The statutes provided ample allowances for
breakfast, dinner, and supper, with the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
certain fisheries. In practice breakfast was omitted
altogether, and for dinner the only kind of meat
provided for the scholars throughout the year was
mutton, which even if good in quality was not
sufficient in quantity.</p>

<p>According to the statutes thirteen servitors were
to wait upon the Provost, Fellows, and scholars in
Hall, which arrangement had further developed into
the Lower boys waiting upon the Upper, who in
their turn performed the same menial offices for
the Provost and his company on the occasions of
their dining in the College Hall.</p>

<p>The statutes required that each scholar should
be instructed free under the most strict oath to be
taken by the Head and Lower Masters. In direct
defiance of this each scholar was charged £6, 6s.,
the amount having been gradually increased to
that sum.</p>

<p>The statutes allowed each Fellow a separate
apartment, but such accommodation had long ceased
to be sufficient for them, and instead they resided
in spacious houses, free from taxes and the expense
of repair, with stables and coach-houses attached.</p>

<p>The statutes enjoined that one room should be
provided for every three boys, free from any
expense. In 1834 upwards of forty boys slept in
Long Chamber, whilst those who were lodged in
the two adjoining rooms paid a sum of money
annually to the second master.</p>

<p>The statute that any scholar during a short
illness should be maintained at the College expense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
(if longer than a month, to receive a sum of money)
was entirely ignored.</p>

<p>Finally, the statutes were required to be read
to the scholars assembled in a body three times a
year. This was never done; the scholars, moreover,
were not allowed access to them.</p>

<p>It should also be added that the statute which
forbade Fellows of the College to hold benefices
had long been treated with utter contempt, they
holding them to any amount.</p>

<p>If, however, the Eton authorities had contented
themselves with merely breaking the statutes in
the way of malversation of funds and the like, no
particular outcry would in all probability have
arisen. It was Long Chamber, and the state of
affairs within its walls, which excited such indignation
amongst those who, denouncing it as a sort of
Bastille, clamoured for reform. Originally all the
seventy scholars seem to have slept in the long
dormitory above Lower School, but after 1716 the
number became limited to about fifty-two. In
that year the Lower Master, Thomas Carter, having
given up his two rooms at the east end, eighteen
Collegers were located in the rooms in question,
being henceforth known as Carter’s Chamber and
Lower Chamber.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LONG CHAMBER</div>

<p>Long Chamber, about 172 feet long and 15
feet high, was in winter warmed, or rather not
warmed, by two fire-places which were put in in
1784; before that there were no fires at all. Along
each wall was a range of old oaken bedsteads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
which had been there for centuries, and between
every bedstead a high desk, with a cupboard
beneath, for each boy. The desk and cupboard,
painted lead colour, contained all their belongings.
There was no system of lighting except candles,
to hold which no provision was made. The leaf
of a book torn off, doubled, and a hole cut in the
centre, formed the only candlestick which the
Colleger had. If he wished to read in bed, the
candle was removed from the pasteboard candlestick
and stuck against the back of the old
bedstead. Even if sleep overcame a boy reading
in bed, and his candle burnt down to the wood, no
harm came of it, the bedstead being well striped
with charcoal, an evidence of the incombustible
nature of the old oak. [After Long Chamber had
been done away with, some little models of these
ancient bedsteads were made out of wood black
with age. The Rt. Hon. Lewis Harcourt’s Eton
collection contains one.] All that happened was that
it would not be long before he would be awakened
by the unpleasant smell of the wood, or by a good
tweak of the nose from his next-door neighbour,
who would be angry at the annoyance. In winter
the boys shivered with cold, most of the glass in the
windows being usually broken.</p>

<p>There were but a very few chairs for the Sixth
Form, and the barrack or prison (boys were locked
into it at 6.30 in the evening), with the exception
of a table with a basin for the highest boys, was
totally devoid of washstands, Collegers having to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
perform such ablutions as they might deem
necessary at the old pump in the cloisters. The
walls and ceiling were full of the grime of ages,
whilst the whole place as a general rule was in a
state of intolerable filth. Once a year, however,
some attempt was made to give Long Chamber a
habitable appearance, and the time-honoured
processes to which it was then subjected were
generally sufficiently successful in making visitors
who saw it believe that all was well enough. For
a week before Election Saturday, which took place
at the end of July, “rug-riding” was in full force.
A number of Lower boys were tied up in big rugs
and dragged with a rope by other fags up and
down Long Chamber till the floor shone like a
mirror; the spaces between the beds were also
scrubbed to a corresponding glossiness. On the
Thursday, waggon-loads of beech boughs, cut in
the College woods at Hedgerley and Burnham,
were brought in and the whole of Long Chamber
decorated; the green rugs, edged with gold and
embroidered with the College arms, given by the
Duke of Cumberland in 1735, were then spread on
the beds. A huge flag was hung from the Captain’s
bed and the whole aspect of the room transformed.
Nevertheless the dirt remained beneath.</p>

<p>Except at Election time Long Chamber was not
accessible to visitors, and the King of Prussia
himself was refused admission in 1842, on the plea
that that portion of the College was never
shown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">CARTER’S CHAMBER</div>

<p>Things in the two other rooms appropriated to
the use of the King’s scholars were not much better,
and an extraordinary state of affairs prevailed in
Carter’s Chamber. Whenever the chimney there
became at all foul, the boys used to set fire to it,
and, being very large, the roar it made when blazing
was tremendous, generally much to the annoyance
of the Provost, part of whose lodge was close by.
The fires in question were made with large beechen
logs, placed upon iron dogs, and the Collegers used
to roast potatoes among the ashes. One of these
logs every Lower boy was compelled to saw up
before he went to bed, with a saw that had no
edge. This was one of the most unpleasant
features of a Lower Colleger’s existence, for the
thinnest logs were always chosen by the biggest
boys, leaving the heaviest for poor little fellows
hardly strong enough to lift them. Not infrequently
would the latter dock themselves of
part of their rolls for breakfast in order to be able
to bribe another stronger boy to saw up their
portion for them.</p>

<p>As regards food, the old-time Colleger was
disgracefully treated, no breakfast at all being
provided for him in College. Dinner in Hall
consisted entirely of mutton until about 1840,
when Provost Hodgson added roast and boiled
beef, each one day in the week. Though the
mutton is said to have been of excellent quality,
the manner in which it was served made it often
impossible for a young boy who had not a robust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
appetite to get any dinner at all that he could eat.
The joints were served in messes, a leg or a
shoulder serving for eight boys, a loin or neck
for six, the best joints going to the elder boys.
They were put upon the table, and the boys carved
for themselves. The captain of the joint cut his
own portion liberally from the best part, and passed
it on to the next in seniority, who slashed away at
it after his own taste. A junior fared badly if the
joint happened to be a loin or a shoulder and he
had not appetite enough for the fat and bones.
The knives and forks often ran short, and boys
were occasionally obliged to be content with the
reversion of such adjuncts. On Sundays plum-pudding
of a peculiar construction, by some
considered very palatable, made of unchopped
suet and unstoned raisins, made its appearance.
Indifferent beer was drunk by the Collegers out of
painted tin mugs. On Founder’s Day and Election
Saturday half a chicken and pressed greens was
served to every boy. Beyond this the fare provided,
as has been said, consisted entirely and
solely of mutton. In connection with this, however,
it is but fair to remember that not a few
boys objected to the beef which, at a yet earlier
period, figured on the College menu. One of these,
according to Sir Dudley Carleton, was the “dainty-mouthed”
young Phil Lytton, son of Sir Rowland
Lytton of Knebworth. Collegers whose purses
permitted were allowed to purchase more or less
savoury messes from the cook, one of whose most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
famed dishes was, for some unknown reason,
known as “blue-pill.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">COLLEGE SERVANTS</div>

<p>Three of the Lower boys waited upon Sixth
Form in Hall, handing them their plates and
pouring out their beer, one being specially detailed
to hold back the long sleeves of the gown on the
Upper boy who carved the joint. This custom of
“servitors,” as they were called, perhaps of a too
menial kind, was not unwisely abolished some
thirty years ago, the staff of College servants
having been increased.</p>

<p>Many of the old College servants were characters
like the original Webber, who seems to have inaugurated
the sock shop, which is now Rowland’s,
near Barnes Pool Bridge. Webber was College
cook in the early portion of the last century, in
addition to which he manufactured the birches
then in much request. Owing probably to this, he
incurred a sort of curious unpopularity, a legend
being started that he had run away from the battle
of Waterloo, therefore the usual taunt of the
Collegers, for whom he carved in the Hall, was,
“Pass up to old Webber that we want to see his
Waterloo medal.” The story appears to have been
purely mythical.</p>

also appears in the <a href="#Fig_206">group of College servants</a>,
of whom the sole survivor is the little boy, Mr.
Culliford’s son, who for so many years has been
known to Etonians as the manager of the famous
Eton tailor, Tom Brown. In this group (reproduced
by the courtesy of Mr. Culliford from a
scarce old photograph in his possession) can also
be seen the last College constable, honest old Bott,
who was such a well-known figure in the days when,
with a colleague (one of the same group), he was
responsible for the due maintenance of law and
order. In his long coat of Eton blue, with the
College arms embroidered upon his sleeve, and
glazed top-hat, Bott was a sight which inspired
tramps and petty evil-doers of every sort with
genuine awe, and the vast majority of such folk
took care to give him a wide berth. Bott had done
good service as a soldier, having, it was said,
fought at Albuera and Waterloo, though according
to some his military service had been confined to
serving during the American War. In any case,
the fine old fellow was a typical Englishman of
a robust age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THREEPENNY DAY</div>

<p>On certain days, owing to the observance of
ancient custom, the Colleger’s lot sustained some
amelioration. On February 27th, for instance, the
Provost or his Deputy presented every Colleger,
beginning with the lowest, with a threepenny piece.
The origin of this custom was that Provost Bost
(1477-1504) left a sum which gave each Colleger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
twopence, and Provost Lupton (1504-1535) left them
the extra penny. A doubtful tradition declared
that a Colleger was entitled to half a sheep, and
that the College was merely giving him what was
its equivalent in money during the Middle Ages.
An impudent young Colleger who had heard of
this tradition, being offered his threepence by the
Bursar, Mr. Bethell, a man of very uncertain
temper, once calmly said, “No, thank you, sir; I
want my half sheep.” Bethell flew into a passion,
and exclaimed, “I’ll mention this matter to Dr.
Hawtrey, and have you flogged,” and in due course
Branwell&mdash;so the “Tug” was named&mdash;expiated his
temerity at the block. Threepenny Day, I believe,
is one of the very few old Eton customs which is
still maintained.</p>

<p>Occasionally protests would be made in order
to secure some slight improvement in the dinner.
The execrable quality of the beer in particular was
several times brought to the notice of the Fellows,
but beyond one of their number coming into Hall
and looking at the cans nothing was done.</p>

<p>In comparatively remote times a discussion
took place amongst the authorities on the question
whether it was necessary for the Collegers to
have their potatoes peeled or sent up in their
skins. Two of the Fellows, as it happened, though
not related, bore the same name. One was an
advocate for the peeling system, declaring that the
boys had been treated “like hogs”; the other
opposed it as an unnecessary piece of refinement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
In consequence they were afterwards distinguished
by the Collegers as “Hog R&mdash;&mdash;” and “Peeli-po
R&mdash;&mdash;,” and the descendants of both families,
who were at Eton for many generations, always
bore the hereditary nicknames of “Hogs” and
“Peelipos.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“PUT INTO PLAY”</div>

<p>Besides the squalor and discomfort amidst which
the Collegers lived there was much horse-play and
bullying, and for the most part small boys led a
wretched life. Besides having to undergo various
unpleasant initiatory ceremonies, one of which consisted
in swallowing an unsavoury mixture of salt
and water, their life was rendered wretched by
rough jokes. A bolster shaken down hard at one
end could do a lot of damage, knocking over
candles and ink-pots, or bringing the unsuspicious
to the ground with a well-directed blow on the
ankles from behind. A “Jew,” as a new boy was
called, was also apt to wake up in the night to find
a rope tied to his big toe, by which he was dragged
from his bed. The only chance to escape such
nocturnal visitations was to keep awake for some
time, and, if he heard whispering, to creep out of
bed and under that of a neighbour till he was safe
from danger. Sometimes he would be “put into
play” till he was sore all over. This most disagreeable
ordeal was as follows. Around one of the
large fire-places in Long Chamber two bedsteads
were placed close together on each side, and two at
the end, forming an enclosure. The boy “put into
play” was placed in one corner, next to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
captain, a certain number of the Upper boys being
seated on the bedsteads. At a given signal the
captain started him with a hearty kick, which generally
was sufficiently hard to propel him to the
opposite side; from thence he would be flung back
quite as expeditiously. Bandied about like a
human shuttlecock, bruises would soon begin to
make him sore all over, but only when it was
evident that he was in severe pain would the boy
be released and some shivering little spectator
seized and made to take his place.</p>

<p>Another cruel and brutal College practice which
prevailed throughout the fortnight before Election
was tossing boys in a blanket. Sometimes an unpopular
boy would be put in the blanket with a
quantity of books, when he was certain to be most
severely bruised. The custom was, after forcing
the boy on to one of the small blankets, which was
held all round by the bigger boys, to repeat this
line:</p>

<p class="center">Ibis ab excus<em>so</em> missus ad astra Sa-<em>go</em>.</p>


<p>At the end of the syllable <em>so</em> a little shake was
given, but at the last <em>go</em> he was sent quivering to
the ceiling. A boy named Rowland Williams was
severely injured in one of these tossings. Hurled
up to the ceiling, in his descent he fell sideways on
to a bedpost and was completely scalped. Only
by a most fortunate chance did he escape death,
sustaining concussion of the brain. His scalp, which
hung down his neck, was sewn on again, and by
great good fortune he completely recovered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>A less dangerous though highly unpleasant
ordeal to which new Collegers were subjected was
the ceremony known as “Pricking for Sheriff.” The
boy was laid across the lap of the chief executioner,
face downwards, and into a very tightened and thin
surface of small-clothes the assistant executioners
ran pins, warning the victim that if he screamed
louder than his predecessor he would be elected
Sheriff and fined a bag of walnuts.</p>

<p>At this time the relations between Collegers and
Oppidans were not very cordial, the Lower boys
amongst the latter in particular often rendering
themselves peculiarly objectionable to the King’s
scholars, at whom they were wont to jeer. Sometimes
some especially aggressive little Oppidan
would be caught and taken into Long Chamber,
and either soundly thrashed or caned, or else subjected
to the blanket-tossing process which has
just been mentioned. When this was the case the
victim for some time after had good reason to
remember his half an hour passed amidst the
“Tugs”&mdash;which term in those days was far more
opprobrious than is at present the case.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GOWN</div>

<p>The exact origin of the word “Tug” has never
been cleared up. The most popular explanation has
always been that it is derived from the Latin word
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga</i>, a gown, and referred to the black gowns
they wore, and still wear, in school. It should
here be added that up to 1864 this indispensable
appurtenance of a King’s scholar was made of
cloth and very heavy. In that year, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the light material at present in use was introduced,
while the length of the gown was somewhat
reduced. The old-fashioned gowns contained
pockets, which were often receptacles for viands
and dainties to be smuggled into Long Chamber.
A parody of Gray’s <cite>Ode on Eton College</cite>, written
by a King’s scholar in 1798, alludes to this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentbase">I know my gown when first it flowed
</div><div class="indentbase">An awkward majesty bestowed,
</div><div class="indentone">When waving fresh each woolly wing
</div><div class="indentbase">That worn-out elbows serve to hide,
</div><div class="indentbase">Or else to hold unknown, unspied,
</div><div class="indentone">A loaf or pudding in.
</div></div></div></div>

<p>As far as the writer has been able to ascertain,
the top-hat, or in earlier times its predecessor, the
cocked or three-cornered one, has always been the
head-dress worn by Collegers, though in an illustration<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
representing the Iron Duke being cheered in
the quadrangle in the middle of the forties of the
last century, the King’s scholars are shown wearing
or waving mortar-boards. These, it would appear,
existed only in the imagination of the artist.</p>

<p>The allusion to worn-out elbows in the ditty
given above is significant as to the poverty-stricken
appearance of the Collegers, most of whom were then
very sorrily dressed. Almost without exception
they were boys whose parents had but small means.
As a matter of fact College was never intended to be
an educational refuge for rich or high-born boys,
and, as a highly competent critic has remarked, “A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
young aristocrat in a serge gown is an anomaly not
contemplated by the statutes of the royal founder.”</p>

<p>Before the reforms made in College in 1845
most of the King’s scholars, it must be confessed,
were more of the class intended by Henry VI.
than has since been the case. In latter years
many Collegers have belonged to well-to-do or even
rich families, whereas the Foundation was specially
intended for poor boys. In the early part of the
nineteenth century a certain proportion of those in
College were the sons of Eton or Windsor doctors
or solicitors, royal servants, or successful tradesmen.
Besides these there were sons of Eton masters and
boys of impoverished country squires. The former
class of boys, however, were in some way made to
feel that they were not the equals of the sons of
gentlemen, and subjected to petty humiliations
which did their schoolfellows small honour.</p>

<p>Besides being exposed to physical violence,
small boys, especially if they were clever, were
sometimes made to do work for stupid big ones.
A certain lazy lout, however, was once well served
out by his victim. In difficulties as to the composition
of a set of verses, the bully one day
got hold of a smaller schoolmate, and under the
threat of a severe licking got him to do the verses
for him. When, however, the bully came to
showing up the lines which he had not done, and
which he had not even troubled to read, they
were found to be so grossly indecent and outrageous
in tone that the master who looked at them at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
once declared the writer should be flogged. At
first the bully did not dare admit that they were
not of his own making, but eventually at the
block he admitted the fraud, with the result that
the boy who had played him the trick was also
punished. It is to be hoped, however, that the
bully received the more severe thrashing of the two.</p>

<p>When the celebrated Porson was a Colleger, one
of his contemporaries was Charles Simeon, known
as “Snowball” Simeon, the ugliest boy in College,
who afterwards became an earnest Evangelical
preacher. In after life he looked back upon the
doings in Long Chamber and its lawless rowdyism
with horror, and once told a friend that he would
be tempted even to murder his own son sooner
than let him see in College the sights he had seen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A RUNAWAY</div>

<p>Under such circumstances it is not surprising
that small Collegers, if they were sensitive boys,
occasionally made determined attempts to run away.
One did so more than thirteen times, and became so
well known on the road that he was almost sure
to be stopped before he got far. Nevertheless he
once got up to town in a very curious manner.
He slunk early, before morning school, into the
yard of the Christopher; the London coach was
standing outside, and no one by, so he was able
unobserved to creep into the boot, trusting to luck,
which befriended him, for there chanced to be
that morning no passengers, and consequently no
luggage to be stowed away. The runaway was
therefore driven without disturbance in his uneasy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
berth, which he only vacated on the arrival of the
coach at the White Horse cellars in Piccadilly.</p>

<p>The general tone in College was somewhat
rough and irreverent, as may be judged from the
following. Every Sunday morning at nine o’clock
the Collegers assembled in Lower School for
prayers, the headmaster sitting in the desk, and a
praepostor standing up repeating the Confession
and a prayer or two out of the Winchester Prayer-Book.
All joined in the 100th Psalm, which
sometimes, more especially towards the end of the
Half, was made the occasion of a not very seemly
demonstration. During the last Sunday the order
went round that every one was to sing his loudest,
and on one occasion the noise was so terrific that
it could almost be heard in the playing fields.
Keate, who was at that time in the desk, did not,
however, take any notice of this irreverent outburst.
He had been a youthful Colleger himself,
and probably considered that the whole thing was
merely a too enthusiastic performance of an old
Eton tradition, which in his eyes excused a good deal.</p>

<p>In school work the Collegers then, as now, easily
maintained an almost unchallenged supremacy.
Almost without exception the sons of poor parents,
accurately grounded and imbued with the idea
that education was a real preparation for life,
they knew that they would have to make their
way in the world by their own exertions, for
which reason to be “a sap” in College was quite
an ordinary thing. Besides this, sixty or seventy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
years ago the very traditional customs which
excluded a King’s scholar from comparatively expensive
amusements, such as the boats, and made
him a member of a separate football and cricket
club, served to protect a boy from drifting into
various forms of fashionable idleness.</p>

<p>At one time few boys went into College who
had not previously been Oppidans, and, till
Provost Hodgson’s reforms made it possible for
every boy to have a separate cubicle room, Collegers
used to have rooms down town or in their tutor’s
houses, where they could escape from fag masters
and the disorder of Long Chamber. In such
rooms they could work, wash, and eat in peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRONE’S</div>

<p>Up to 1864 King’s scholars had to wear their
gowns out of school, though they abandoned them
before passing over Barnes Pool Bridge. A sock
shop in the High Street called Trone’s was almost
exclusively frequented by King’s scholars because
they were allowed to leave their gowns there when
going into Windsor. Oppidans never frequented
it, and, curiously enough, as showing the persistence
of traditional usage, years later, when the shop
had changed owners, though no one could give
any particular reason, it was supposed to be
“scuggish” to pass its doors.</p>

<p>Whilst Long Chamber could never have been
called an abode of bliss, it had its pleasures, one of
the chief of which was the rat-hunting, in which
Porson is said to have taken so much delight. If
the Colleges lacked food they never lacked game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
in the shape of rats, which fairly swarmed about
the ancient dormitory. Some of these animals
which defied capture became well known to the
boys, who in a sort of way felt a respect for one
veteran&mdash;an immense, perfectly gray old rat, which
was supposed to be the ghost of King Henry VI.,
or at any rate to have been in being from the very
first foundation of the College.</p>

<p>All sorts of food was constantly being smuggled
in. According to tradition, a sow was once
captured and stowed away on the leads till she
had farrowed and provided roast sucking-pig in
abundance. Hares and other game surreptitiously
caught in Windsor Park furnished many a hearty
feast. The Collegers were anything but particular,
and on one occasion, it is said, actually roasted and
ate an unfortunate swan which they had lured to
its doom.</p>

<p>A great College institution was Fire-place&mdash;a
supper held before a roaring blaze, carefully set
going by Lower boys in one of the two huge
grates in Long Chamber, under the eyes of the
captain of the room, who enjoyed the privilege of
granting an extension of revelling time (known as
a half-holiday) beyond the hour of ten, when boys
were expected to be in bed. Five bedsteads were
run out in two parallel rows around the Upper
Fire-place, one facing the cheerful glow, and an
impromptu supper took place, the boys consuming
such provisions as they had been able to smuggle
in. A certain amount of these were obtained from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the Christopher “on tick,” whilst a common dish
was a grill made of scrag ends of mutton and bones
purloined from Hall. Songs followed this supper,
the proceedings, which terminated at eleven, being
enlivened by College songs roared in chorus. These
were chiefly of a Bacchanalian or nautical order;
some also dealt with poaching. A favourite song
was “The fine old Eton Colleger&mdash;one of the
Olden Time.” The last verse of this ran:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentbase">Now times are changed, and we are changed, and Keate has passed away,
</div><div class="indentbase">Still College hearts and College hands maintain old Eton’s sway;

</div><div class="indentbase">We still will beat the Oppidans at bat and foot and oar,
</div><div class="indenttwo">Like the fine old Eton Collegers,
</div><div class="indenttwo">Those of the olden time.
</div></div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">JOHNNY BEAR</div>

<p>Not infrequently very palatable viands were obtained
by the Upper boys and real banquets held, the
pleasures of which were enhanced by the potations
which “Johnny Bear” brought from the Christopher
and pushed through the bars of Lower
Chamber, the usual receiving-room of all smuggled
goods, on the ground floor and adjoining the
school-yard. The Lower boy whose turn it was to
watch for Johnny’s arrival had pretty good cause
to remember such visits on cold nights.</p>

<p>The Headmaster’s servant, it should be added,
was entrusted with the duty of seeing that no
Colleger got out at night. Strict fidelity to this
duty made him highly unpopular, for he would
never consent to be bribed. Principal and only
locker-up and gaoler to the boys, birch collector,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and rod distributor, he was generally known by the
mythological appellation of Cerberus.</p>

<p>Life in Long Chamber, like most unpleasant
ordeals, had its alleviations. Once a year, for
instance, there was an impromptu masquerade,
concluded by a march round, for which Jobey Joel,
an Eton character who survived till a few years ago,
supplied the music, and, extraordinary as it may
seem, theatricals flourished unchecked. Such performances
dated back to the early eighteenth
century, since which time they had been given with
the full knowledge of the authorities. In 1762, it
is true, Dr. Barnard, who was then Headmaster,
had tried to stop them, bursting in upon a representation
of <cite>Cato</cite>, and, much to his disgust, finding
that a long wig which he tore from one of the
actor’s heads belonged to the Vice-Provost; but no
drastic measures were taken, and theatricals continued
to take place as before. Out of Long
Chamber, however, the drama was tabooed. Both
Drs. Keate and Hawtrey connived at the performances
in Long Chamber, the latter especially
ignoring all theatrical preparations even when they
were right under his nose. Favourite pieces were
<cite>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite>, <cite>High Life below
Stairs</cite>, and <cite>Orlando Furioso</cite>. For the purposes of
this last play, Anson&mdash;a powerful Colleger&mdash;once
actually smuggled a donkey into College, where
it was stabled and fed till brought out to carry
Bombastes. The last play ever given in Long
Chamber was <cite>A Night in China</cite>, written by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Colleger named King, and played in 1845. After
this, however, some Collegers, amongst whom
was Frank Tarver, afterwards well known to
several generations of Etonians as French Master,
indulged in theatricals at the back of Turnock’s
tailor’s shop in the town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. BOURCHIER’S ETON DAYS</div>

<p>Eton has furnished some capital recruits to
the London stage&mdash;Charles Kean, the brothers
Hawtrey, Mr. Willie Elliot, and others, including
that excellent actor, Mr. Arthur Bourchier, who
even as an Eton boy was celebrated for his dramatic
zeal. About 1882, with Bogle Smith, Collet,
Gilmor, and a few more, he organised the “Eton
Strollers,” the prologue for whose first play was
written by the Hon. Arthur Bligh, a boy of considerable
literary and poetic taste, who, in collaboration
with Bourchier, wrote a drama which was
sent to Irving for production. “Do these boys
play cricket?” inquired the great actor when
he received the manuscript; as a matter of fact
both were very fair cricketers, Bourchier being a
good wicket-keep.</p>

<p>Mr. Bourchier’s first theatrical <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrepreneur</i> was
Lord Kenyon, in whose room at Cameron’s he
made his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</i> in <cite>Uncle’s Will</cite>, in which he acted
with Johnson and Berkeley-Levett. When Mr.
Cameron, who was not sympathetic to theatricals,
left Eton, Bourchier went to the Rev. T. Dalton’s,
where his aspirations received far greater encouragement;
indeed his Housemaster became imbued
with such enthusiasm for theatricals that a colleague<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
once chaffingly inquired of him, “Is it true that
young Bourchier is going to bring you out on the
Music Hall stage?” Regular performances were
now given in Pupil Room, for which a small charge&mdash;generally
a penny a seat&mdash;was made, the proceeds
going to the Eton Mission, for the benefit of which
the whole company, including Mr. Dalton (who gave
a humorous recitation), gave an entertainment at
Hackney Wick.</p>

<p>The exigences of the drama, however, occasionally
clashed with discipline. When, for instance,
in <cite>Still Waters Run Deep</cite>, after the lines, “Do
you smoke?” “Yes, I’ll have a cigar,” two of the
actors lit up, Mr. Dalton from his place amongst
the audience shouted out, “No, you don’t,” and
was only appeased by an examination of the cigars,
which proved to be dummies. On another occasion
when a careless or mischievous Lower boy had
manufactured snow for the duel scene in the
<cite>Corsican Brothers</cite> by tearing up a pile of “extra-works”
which had been lying on Mr. Dalton’s desk
for correction, the latter became so scandalised at
seeing the duellists enveloped in a “cloud of
equations” that, after ejaculating, “One minute!
This performance now ceases,” he set actors and
audience to the uncongenial task of putting the
pieces together. The most ambitious effort of the
company was an elaborate performance of <cite>The
Merchant of Venice</cite>, in which Reggie Lucas (<a href="#Page_286">see
Chapter X</a>.) took part.</p>

<p>Bourchier was celebrated for his imitations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Masters, about the most amusing of which was an
impersonation of a certain squeaky-voiced tutor
after he had been cut over by an imaginary cricket
ball. As luck would have it, the latter, whilst
playing in an eleven of Masters against boys, one
of whom was Bourchier, did happen to sustain
a painful injury, with the result that he proceeded
to give an almost exact reproduction of himself
as portrayed by his imitator, who could not help
being convulsed with laughter as he led the sufferer
off the ground. Later on, the victim, who, of
course, had no idea of the real cause of this merriment,
said to a colleague, “What hurt me more than
the pain was the brutality of the boy Bourchier.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“UNDER THE CLOCK”</div>

<p>In course of time Bourchier formed his imitations
into a sketch, entitled <cite>Under the Clock</cite>, which
depicted a number of Eton Masters at Lord’s, and
before he left the late Mr. R. A. H. Mitchell
arranged that this should be heard by the individuals
concerned, whom he posted behind trees in Poet’s
Walk whilst the author gave his performance close
by. They were all very much amused, and when
it was over came forward to congratulate the
youthful aspirant to dramatic fame, whom they
shook warmly by the hand and wished him all
success in his future career.</p>

<p>To return to the story of College&mdash;the pleasures
as well as the trials of Long Chamber came to
an end in 1845, for in September of that year
the new buildings were opened and the old
days of College became mere memories of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
obsolete age. The discomforts and hardships of
Long Chamber were then forgotten by most of the
boys who had slept there. In spite of the far
better conditions they chafed at the lack of freedom
and the end of “Fire-place” with its suppers and
choruses. The Chamber itself, though not pulled
down, was entirely remodelled, cubicles for a
limited number of boys being constructed and the
whole place made habitable and clean.</p>

<p>Election Saturday, the glories of which have
now departed for ever, was a great day not only for
those in College, whom it more immediately concerned,
but for the whole school. At two o’clock
the Provost of King’s College, Cambridge, attended
by two examiners called “Posers,” drove into
Weston’s Yard. The arrival of his yellow coach,
drawn by four smoking horses, always produced
great excitement. Meeting the Provost of Eton,
a kiss of peace was exchanged (abandoned in Dr.
Hawtrey’s days for a handshake). A speech was
then made in Latin by the captain of the school
under the archway of Lupton’s Tower, its main
purport being the offering of congratulations to the
Provost on his arrival at the College. The rest of
the programme was much the same as that still
gone through on the 4th of June&mdash;speeches in the
Upper School at eleven, banquet of dons in the
College Hall at two, processions of the boats in the
evening to Surly Hall, with fireworks off the Eyot
on the return, and finally, sock suppers in all the
houses. The fun on Election Saturday, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
was always more fast and furious than on the
4th of June, because the school was to break up
on the following Monday, and the boys who were
going to leave looked upon themselves as already
emancipated. For this reason turbulent spirits did
not scruple to commit all sorts of extravagances,
being pretty sure that just preceding the holidays
they would escape unpunished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE POSERS</div>

<p>On the Tuesday and Wednesday following,
candidates for College were examined, as well as
scholars seeking election to King’s. The “Posers,”
or examining chaplains, were terrific gentlemen in
the eyes of the boys; whilst examination took
place, Election-chamber was to most an awful room,
then rendered somewhat weird and uncanny by the
light filtering through an immense red curtain, let
down at the large oriel window, which imparted a
sort of devilish appearance to the “Posers.”</p>

<p>A very quaint old usage existed in connection
with these “Posers,” each of them being attended
by a Colleger, who waited upon him in Hall and
elsewhere if required, for which the boy&mdash;quaintly
called the “Poser’s child”&mdash;received a fee of a
guinea, selection for the office by the Headmaster
being regarded as being a sort of minor honour. The
existence of this curious custom, which of course
died a natural death with the “Posers” themselves,
has generally, I think, escaped mention in books
dealing with Eton. It was brought to my notice
by my old tutor, Mr. H. W. Mozley (Newcastle
Scholar, 1860), who in this and other ways has given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
me valuable information which I here acknowledge;
he himself had been “Poser’s child” in 1859.</p>

<p>The days following Election Saturday were
always particularly depressing and gloomy, and the
poor King’s scholars had a melancholy time. The
gentlemen, as the tradespeople had the impertinence
to call the Oppidans, went home on the
Monday, whilst Collegers had to wait until the
Thursday. All the shops were shut up, and
scarcely any one about.</p>

<p>Collegers, like Oppidans, then remained at
Eton longer than at present&mdash;as late as 1874
there was a King’s Scholar, Tuck by name,
who was said to have been nine years at the
school. In the days when such a close connection
existed between Eton and King’s, a Colleger
leaving to go to Cambridge used to go through
the old form known as “Ripping.” This was
performed at the Provost’s Lodge. The two
folds of the Colleger’s serge gown were sewn
together in front, and the Provost “ripped” them
asunder, pronouncing some Latin formula, after
which he congratulated the embryo scholar of
King’s, and gave him good advice as to his future
career. The gown, it must be remembered, was
then an essential part of the Colleger’s equipment
out of as well as in school. Although the rule was
not strictly adhered to, they were even supposed
to wear their gowns whilst playing games.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ETON’S DIVORCE FROM KINGS</div>

<p>All the picturesque features of Election disappeared
in the sixties, when new statutes were substituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
for those of the Founder, and the relations
between King’s College, Cambridge, and Eton
entirely changed. In 1861 William Austen
Leigh and Felix Cobbold were elected to King’s.
With them ended the ancient succession of Eton
scholars after it had continued, with few if any
interruptions, under the statutes of Henry VI., for
the period of four hundred and nineteen years,
William Hatecliffe (1443), afterwards Secretary
to King Edward IV., and Felix Thornley Cobbold
(1862) being the first and last scholars.
The right of the latter to a scholarship at King’s
was, it should be added, disputed, as was that of
William Austen Leigh, the Provost and Fellows
of the Cambridge College urging that the new
statutes were already in operation. This question,
which never ought to have been raised, inasmuch
as the names of these boys were on the indenture
before the existence of the new statutes, was submitted
to legal opinion and then to the “Visitor.”
It was eventually justly decided that the two Eton
scholars were entitled to scholarships at King’s
College, with all their rights, emoluments, and consequences,
and with this terminated the ancient and
sisterly connection between the two Foundations.</p>

<p>The new statutes provided that four scholarships
at King’s should be annually offered for competition
to the scholars of Eton, tenable for six years, value
£80 per annum, with tuition, rooms, and commons
free. The injury done to the interests of Eton by
the new arrangements was very great, for four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
scholarships per annum did not amount to the
average of the old succession, which ranged from
four and a half to five, while the difference between
a scholarship of six years’ tenure and one which
led to a Fellowship that might be held for life
was so great as to be difficult to calculate. The
remarkable features in these iniquitous changes
were the earnestness with which they were pressed
by King’s, which seemingly was anxious to rid
itself of its connection with Eton&mdash;that is, as far
as it could&mdash;and the weakness of Eton and its
dereliction of duty to itself and its scholars in
acquiescing in them without any attempt to
obtain any mitigation or revision which might
certainly have been effected. Henry Norris
Churton, the first Colleger to be affected by
the new state of affairs, declined to accept the
scholarship at King’s to which he was elected in
July, but Richard Durnford, elected in the same
month, did accept, and thus became the first Eton
scholar who went to King’s under the new statutes.</p>

<p>A few years later&mdash;in 1871&mdash;the repeal of the
entire code of statutes which had regulated Eton
since the 21st December, 1443, did a good deal
more towards nullifying the wishes of Henry VI.
The old statutes laid down that there should be
seventy <em>poor</em> scholars&mdash;an important clause which
the new ones abolished. At present, directly contrary
to the Founder’s intention, there is nothing
to prevent the son of a multi-millionaire from competing
for an Eton scholarship.</p>

<h2>VIII<br />
SCHOOL WORK</h2>


<p>Whilst Eton has occasionally produced some very
fine scholars&mdash;the Marquis Wellesley was a case in
point&mdash;it cannot be said that the traditions of the
school are very favourable to learning, which to a
large proportion of Etonians has seemed of less
importance than the acquisition of worldly wisdom.
More than a hundred years ago De Quincey noted
the peculiar tone which prevailed amongst Eton
boys, who showed a premature knowledge of the
world far exceeding that possessed by the scholars
at any other school. The graceful self-possession
of the boys attracted his attention, but he thought
them lacking in self-restraint. Such an accusation,
however, could not justly be made in more modern
days, when a sort of genial unconcern has come to
be regarded as one of the principal characteristics
of the typical Etonian, who, preferring anecdote to
argument, is profoundly convinced that amongst
human institutions his school stands easily first.</p>

<p>With respect to most modern criticisms which
have been levelled against the system of education,
it must be remembered that in their efforts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
teach, the masters are handicapped by one or two
fundamental difficulties not easy to surmount.</p>

<p>Eton, in a much larger proportion than any
other school, has contained, and does contain, the
children of rich parents, boys of good birth and
large expectations, most of whom realise very early
in life that there is no absolute necessity for them
to work; consequently something like a leaven of
indolence permeates the school, the tone of which
it is, perhaps unjustly, said has of late years
been impaired by an increasing number of sons of
millionaire parvenus, who are allowed extravagant
sums by parents anxious to forward the social
success of their offspring by any kind of means.
Such parents for the most part have no real wish
that their boys should be educated at all, and send
them to Eton simply to form friendships and to be
turned into gentlemen; or perhaps merely because
Eton enjoys the reputation of being a fashionable
school. Be this as it may, the number of rich boys
sprung from the commercial, or rather financial,
classes has undoubtedly increased, whilst foreigners
now flock to Eton in ever-swelling numbers. As
a result tales, probably untrue, have been circulated
of wealthy boys achieving a spurious popularity
owing to their pockets being constantly replenished
from home, whilst, according to one incredible
rumour, the sons of certain rich speculators, imbued
with an hereditary faculty for money-making, have,
on occasions, not hesitated to loan portions of their
abundant funds at an extravagant rate of interest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
The writer, be it understood, does not for a moment
say that such a state of affairs really exists, but the
fact remains that such things have been whispered,
of course with no increase to the prestige of the
school. It is not healthy for boys to be allowed
unlimited pocket-money, and men of moderate
means&mdash;belonging to what may be called “old
Eton families”&mdash;do not care to expose their sons
to the contamination of mingling with schoolmates
of alien blood whose sole claim to consideration
lies in their parent’s enormous wealth. In addition
to this, quite a number of foreign boys are sent
to be educated at Eton, which has occasionally
not proved altogether advantageous to the best
interests of the school.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MODERN ETON</div>

<p>Modern Eton as it is to-day may be said to have
originated from the recommendations of the Public
School Commission, which began its work in 1861,
at which time a wind of change was blowing about
old places in England, with the result that many
a weather-worn relic went down before it. As
a result of the labours of this body, the charm
of the school’s celestial quiet was broken, some of
the evidence taken having revealed an unsatisfactory
state of affairs which seemed to call for drastic
change. It was, for instance, conclusively shown
that the masters had more on their hands than they
could do, and some did not make any scruple about
complaining. “We are enormously overworked,”
said one. “There is no time,” said another, “for
society, for meeting each other, for relaxation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
no time, I may say, for private reading, and I
consider that prejudicial to the school.” In fact,
as Mr. Commissioner Vaughan put it, it seemed a
characteristic of the Eton system that “the masters
did too much for the boys, and the boys did too
little for themselves.” The real state of affairs at
Eton at that time was that an immense deal of
work was got out of the masters, and little out
of the boys. Since those days the number of
masters has swelled to the very adequate number
of sixty-five or more, exclusive of the Head and
Lower Master, but the tutorial system, which has
at various times aroused a good deal of adverse
criticism, remains unchanged, and in all probability
will continue to flourish as long as Eton lasts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEAD AND LIVING TONGUES</div>

<p>Half a century ago it was urged that the main
mistake in the Eton system lay in the retention of the
dead languages as the staple of school work, whilst
the panacea put forward for the admitted ignorance
of Young England was the adoption by the
majority of boys of what is known as a “special
education.” With some justice it was urged that
as a boy when he goes out into the great world is
unlikely to read much Greek, and even less likely
to write much Latin verse, his school days had
much better be occupied in learning something
which is practical and useful. Whilst the classics
are still the main feature of the school curriculum,
a boy may now, on having reached a certain
standard (usually attained about the age of <span class="nowrap">16 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span>),
learn modern languages, science, history, mathematics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
or continue to study Greek and Latin,
according as he, or rather his parents, may decide.
In addition to this, the Army class provides an
alternative course of study for those about to
enter upon a military career.</p>

<p>An entirely new feature is that a number of
boys going to Eton now enter for the foundation
examination, though without any idea of becoming
King’s scholars should they pass. In July 1910
three of the nineteen scholars who passed into
Eton entered as “Oppidan scholars.”</p>

<p>With regard to the modern languages mentioned
above, it is to be hoped that the old Eton method
of teaching has been discarded. In the past the
time set apart for French was too often merely
a farcical interlude, during which boys devoted all
their energies to teasing the master! The old
classical system would be preferable if anything of
the sort survives, for, after all, even a slight knowledge
of the classics is better than an imperfectly
assimilated smattering of a modern tongue. In
old days very thorough methods were adopted
in connection with Latin and Greek. One luckless
lad in Keate’s division construed <cite>Exegi</cite>,
I have eaten; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">monumentum</i>, a monument; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">perennius</i>,
harder; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aere</i>, than brass. “Oh, you have,
have you?” said the Doctor; “then you’ll stay
afterwards, and I’ll give you something to help
digest it,” and he did. On the whole, educational
authorities are still loth to exclude Latin and
Greek. The Commission of fifty years ago, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
hearing much evidence, were of this opinion. The
Commissioners reported:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We believe that for the instruction of boys, especially
when collected in a large school, it is material that there
should be some one principal branch of study, invested with
a recognised and, if possible, a traditional importance, to
which the principal weight should be assigned and the
largest share of time and attention given. We believe that
this is necessary in order to concentrate attention, to stimulate
industry, to supply to the whole school a common
ground of literary interest, and a common path of promotion....
We are of opinion that the classical languages and
literature should continue to hold, as they do now, the
principal place in public school education.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is certainly much to be said for Latin
as an aid to the acquirement of “exact expression,”
but Greek is another matter altogether.
According to the writer’s own experience, the
majority of boys never obtained any real grip
upon that defunct tongue, besides which, for all
but an infinitesimal number, in after life Greek,
as Mr. Andrew Carnegie has somewhat bluntly
put it, “is of no more use than Choctaw.”</p>

<p>The old Eton system was largely composed of
paradoxical omissions, and by an extraordinary
fiction boys were supposed to be thoroughly
acquainted with subjects such as modern geography
and arithmetic, of which, in reality, they knew
nothing at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MATHEMATICS</div>

<p>Within comparatively recent years mathematics
had no regular place in the curriculum of the
school. It is true that there was an “extra”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
master or two who was allowed to take those who
liked to be taught and charged, but he had no
means of enforcing discipline, and, however irritated
he might be, had no right to complain to the Headmaster.
In Mr. Gladstone’s Eton days Major
Hexter, who kept a boarding-house, and was
styled the writing-master, taught mathematics.
Only the Lower boys, however, went to him, and
when they were certified as proficient in long
division the Major troubled them no more. When
in 1836 the Rev. Stephen Hawtrey came to the
school as mathematical master he was only allowed
to give his lessons as “extras,” and to the first
thirty boys in the school, because Major Hexter
was supposed to have a vested interest in the
ignorance of the remainder. The whole thing
ended in Mr. Hawtrey paying the Major a pension
of £200 a year, so that the latter’s opposition to the
teaching of Euclid and algebra might be withdrawn.</p>

<p>Even after he had obtained a more or less
regular position, Mr. Stephen Hawtrey’s lot was
none too happy, and this most kindly man passed
many irritating half-hours in the round theatrical-looking
building which some called the “Station
House.” Those boys whose parents desired it
were entered on the books of this establishment,
but the time spent there was one rather of recreation
than of study. Mischievous boys were constantly
turning off the gas or letting off squibs
and crackers, especially in November, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
a particularly merry season. Besides this, the
unfortunate master did not receive much sympathy
or commiseration from his classical superiors, being
in a measure regarded as an interloper and an
enemy to versification.</p>

<p>The last writing-master as provided for by the
ancient statutes was a Mr. Harris, who always
resented not being allowed to wear a cap and
gown like the other masters. Highly tenacious of
such privileges as he could contrive to obtain, he
was always well pleased when small boys touched
their hats to him in the street, punctiliously
returning such salutations with a grand sweep of
the arm. A hater of steel pens, one of his
principal occupations was mending quills and
trying their nibs on his thumb-nail. He had
always a quill behind one of his ears, occasionally
behind both; and, being a little absent-minded,
would sometimes, to the general delight, sally forth
from school with his hat on and a pair of fresh-mended
quills sticking out underneath. Mr.
Harris taught only Lower boys, but big ones,
whose bad hand-writing had attracted attention,
were sometimes sent to him to learn how to write
properly; this, needless to say, was looked upon as
a great humiliation.</p>

<p>The old Eton system could not, of course, fit
a boy for a commercial or business career&mdash;as a
matter of fact it was never intended to do so. The
modern system, on the other hand, makes something
more than a pretence of equipping Etonians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
for any profession they may select, though, considering
the traditions of the school, this is no
easy task. The old idea was that, exclusive of the
Collegers, a number of whom were always fine
scholars, it did not much matter if the boys were
taught Sanscrit or Chinese, the main purpose of an
Eton education being not so much to inculcate
what was vulgarly called “book-learning,” as to
fit Etonians to take their place in the great world
outside.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“TARDY-BOOK”</div>

<p>Of late years, however, the authorities have
made real progress in their efforts to convert
“an Eton education” into more of a reality.
The facilities for study at Eton have always been
good, and within recent years much has been done
to improve them, with, it would seem, satisfactory
results. White tickets have been invented as a
final supreme punishment when yellow tickets have
failed to make a culprit realise his own shortcomings,
whilst the quaintly named “Tardy-book,”
an institution of entirely modern origin, has been
devised to strike terror into those who make a
practice of being late for school.</p>

<p>The old haphazard methods which formerly
prevailed have been discarded in favour of more
business-like ways, the school office, which undertakes
the distribution of much connected with the
work of the school, being a thoroughly workmanlike
and efficient institution. In its early days, however,
a few things somehow got mislaid, which, of course,
furnished unscrupulous boys who had failed to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
any punishment with the plausible excuse that
their lines had got lost there.</p>

<p>Much less idleness seems now to prevail, the
boys being certainly forced to work more than
was the case in the writer’s day, when so many of
them, it must be admitted, learnt very little indeed,
contriving to go through the school with a really
surprising lack of mental effort. To such as these
the only real time of danger was Trials, when they
were absolutely obliged to make some attempt at
working. Most idlers, however, took such an ordeal
very lightly, occasionally supplementing their defective
memories by various ingenious contrivances.
An expert once, it is said, equipped himself as
follows: Right waistcoat pocket, Greek verbs; left
waistcoat pocket, Latin verbs; breast pocket, crib
to Horace; right tail pocket, crib to Virgil; left
tail pocket, crib to Homer; finger-nails, important
dates. His ingenuity, however, was all wasted, for
he was plucked. The amount of application and
intelligence needful to take a good place in such
examinations was formerly quite moderate.</p>

<p>Cunning boys had all sorts of ways of avoiding
work. Some could calculate to a nicety when they
were likely to be put on to construe, and learnt
only a particular bit. One master for a long time
made it a practice to call upon each boy in turn
right through his division, with the result that they
confined themselves to learning only about a dozen
lines or so apiece. At last, however, the trick was discovered,
and one fatal morning the master caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
consternation by putting on the first boy at the
end instead of the beginning. A general collapse
ensued, boy after boy standing dumbfoundered
and speechless, instead of rattling off his portion
with glib proficiency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUNDAY QUESTIONS</div>

<p>Thirty or forty years ago, it may safely be
affirmed, any boy of ordinary intelligence who had
received a good grounding at a private school could
manage to make his way up to the higher forms
without once “muffing Trials,” and yet not increase
his stock of learning in the very slightest degree.
He lived, as it were, upon a capital of knowledge
imbibed in the very different atmosphere of some
hard-working preparatory school. The enthusiasm
for learning which inspired many a boy fresh from
such modest seminaries was too often quickly
cooled by the banks of the Thames. It was, indeed,
admitted by not a few that the longer a boy
remained at Eton the more lazy he became. One
cheeky lad, indeed, being lectured for idleness by
his tutor, who at the same time eulogised the
industry of a comparatively new comer, was met
by the answer, “Well, sir, I have been here three
years and he only one.” The tone, at least amongst
the majority of the Oppidans, was not encouraging
to enthusiasm of any kind, besides which the frank
absurdity of certain portions of the Eton curriculum
was calculated merely to depress a boy gifted
with even average intelligence. Sunday questions,
for instance, instituted by Dr. Goodford about 1854,
usually resembled nothing so much as a page of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
acrostics, the correct solution of which, whilst
involving a vast amount of trouble, conduced to
anything but a love of the Bible. As an aid to
holy living, for which purpose, I believe, they were
supposed to be devised, no more pitiful failure ever
existed, the sole effects produced being unmitigated
boredom and much bad language. In modern days
they may have been improved, but in their original
form these questions, a number of which dealt with
the genealogies of Hebrew kings, were a most
unstimulating exercise for the youthful brain.</p>

<p>In many other respects the school-work was
idiotically useless and bad, a great part of it having
seemingly been devised to entail a maximum of
drudgery with a minimum of useful information.
Above all, it lacked elasticity, little or no effort
being made to encourage a boy in any particular
subject for which he exhibited aptitude.</p>

<p>Some features of the curriculum might have
been modelled upon the ancient Chinese system.
What could have been more ridiculous than to
make boys who could scarcely construe a simple
sentence attempt to turn out Latin verse? It
would have been far better to teach greater Eton&mdash;that
is, the mass of more or less ignorant
dunces&mdash;how to write a good letter in their own
language, or driven into their brains some knowledge
of modern geography, yet nothing of the
sort was ever attempted.</p>

<p>The writing of Latin verse was one of the most
time-honoured Eton traditions which had to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
undertaken by every boy who emerged from the
Lower Forms of the school, and every week a copy
of verses was set by the masters who took the
divisions of the Fifth Form. These verses had to
be done by the boys as best they could, being submitted
for correction to the tutors, who got the
verses into shape, eliminating “false quantities”
and all other mistakes, in the course of which
operation they themselves often composed a good
deal of Latin poetry. The revised copy was then
returned to the boy, who wrote a “fair copy” out
of school, and afterwards showed up both copies to
the Division Master. The strain on the tutors was
at times great, and unscrupulous boys, with the
additional help of a clever friend, would sometimes
go through the whole of their Eton career without
in the least understanding anything at all about
verse-writing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“TUGS” AND “SAPS”</div>

<p>Such a state of affairs exerted a demoralising effect
upon the minds of earnest, well-meaning boys, who
gradually came to see that certain features of their
education were entirely futile. Besides this, owing
to the general tone of the school, a large part of
which regarded school-work as being merely a sort
of useless way of wasting time, their estimation of
the value of effort of all kind lessened, whilst the
conviction was forced upon them that no particular
<em>kudos</em> was to be gained by conscientious study,
which they came to look upon as the peculiar
appanage of “Tugs” and “Saps.”</p>

<p>No feat of learning on the part of a King’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
scholar ever aroused the slightest surprise, it being
generally assumed that “Tugs,” unlike the rest of
the school, having been born “Saps,” or always
made to work, could master every kind of learning
with the greatest ease. The Newcastle Scholar,
always a boy of high intellectual attainments,
excited no interest amongst the mass of the school&mdash;the
majority indeed scarcely knew who had won
it, and, if asked, would generally reply, “Oh, some
Colleger or other.” No aspirations to gain Balliol
scholarships or places in the class-lists disturbed
the serenity of the Oppidan’s mind. Such petty
ambitions might excite the miserable rivalry of
boys at other schools, vain mortals toiling in the
lower world of scholarship, “vying with and outrunning
and outwitting one another.” In such
contests Eton could afford to look calmly on,
secure in that “repose of character” which has
for so many generations marked her students.
There existed, indeed, a sort of tacit understanding
that it was the business of the Collegers to do
the intellectual work and to win the school and
University honours, whilst the Oppidans were to
prove victorious at Henley and, if possible, beat
Harrow and Winchester at cricket. A great
portion of the school, assuming a natural licence
to be idle, had a deeply implanted conviction
that reading was not in their line, and at heart
believed it was rather a slow thing to do.</p>

<p>The general result of this unsatisfactory standard
of course yielded bad results. Calmly secure in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the conviction that to be in the eight or eleven
was to have reached the highest pinnacle of boyish
ambition, those who excelled in athletics became
naturally prone to undervalue intellectual effort
and attainments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GAMES, NOT WORK</div>

<p>To excel at games, not at work, was the ideal
set before their youthful eyes; no wonder that for
one who persevered in conscientious preparation of
his school-work ten succumbed and became content
to sink lower and lower in Trials, till at last
they just scraped through a few places from the
bottom. Admiration for athletics indeed was
carried to an almost absurd extreme. Whilst there
can be no doubt that exercise and an indulgence in
manly games and healthful forms of relaxation are
excellent for schoolboys, they should be regarded
from a sane and proper point of view, and not held
up as the sole end and aim of human existence.
Curiously enough, scarcely any great men have been
keen athletes during their youthful days, whilst a
large proportion of those who have excelled in the
cricket field or on the river have been utterly
unheard of in after life, where capacity to propel
a boat through the water at high speed or drive a
cricket ball to the boundary counts scarcely at all.
An entire absorption in games to the exclusion of
practically all other interests cannot be called a
healthy feature of education. Loafing, every one
agrees, is a slovenly and demoralising habit, but
fanatical interest in cricket, football, or the river
is bad in another way, for though it may produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
muscle, it may also, when carried to an extreme,
produce atrophy of the brain.</p>

<p>In the rough old days, though sporting pursuits,
like fighting, were in high repute, games do not
appear to have been taken very seriously at Eton,
where there was nothing approaching the modern
spirit which makes heroes of the eight and the
eleven. In the eighteenth century, though games
were played, not a few of the more clever boys
would appear to have viewed them with something
of good-humoured contempt.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I can’t say I’m sorry that I was never quite a schoolboy,”
wrote Horace Walpole; “an expedition against Bargemen,
or a match at cricket may be very pretty things to
recollect; but, thank my stars, I can remember things that
are very near as pretty.”</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">HOOPS</div>

<p>His friend Gray, though in his famous ode he
touched upon the school games, expressed no
particular enthusiasm for athletics:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentbase">What idle progeny succeed
</div><div class="indentbase">To chase the rolling circle’s speed.

<p>Gray, it should be added, originally wrote</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentbase">To chase the hoop’s elusive speed,
</div></div></div></div>

<p>for, extraordinary as it may appear to the modern
Etonian, the hoop was formerly in high favour with
Eton boys. Trundling a hoop has long been recognised
as one of the best forms of exercise; indeed,
the writer has been told that the present Headmaster
of Eton, in his day an athlete of high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
distinction, being once abroad where no games
could be played, in order to keep himself fit
purchased a hoop and took to trundling it with
great zest.</p>

<p>As late as the early part of the nineteenth
century, during the October half, the majority of
Lower School used to indulge in the somewhat
infantile delights of trundling a hoop with a stout
stick. The Eton hoop was made differently from
the ones still used by children, being formed out of
a strong ash lathe with a remnant of bark upon
its surface. The inevitable collisions of hoops and
their trundlers not infrequently led to hostilities,
and on several occasions regular pitched battles
occurred between Collegers and Oppidans. A
famous encounter once took place at the end of
the wall near the Chapel door, about twenty boys
being on each side, one Saturday after four, big
boys in front, little ones behind. Thanks to their
gowns, which they adroitly twisted round one
arm, the Collegers had the best of the encounter,
though the Oppidans were able to draw off without
having been definitely beaten. The contest
excited great interest, a crowd of people watching
the battle, and though the masters were
fully aware of what was going on, no attempt
was made to interfere. For some reason or other,
however, there was no more hoop-trundling till
the following year.</p>

<p>In long-past days another form of amusement,
generally associated with childhood&mdash;marbles&mdash;enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
an occasional popularity amongst Lower
boys, many of whom prided themselves on the
variegated colours contained in their collections,
whilst for a time “Bandalore”&mdash;which, as
“Diabolo,” quite recently enjoyed a great vogue
all over England&mdash;quite captivated the school.</p>

<p>Peg-tops were once in great favour, Weight,
who kept a grocer’s shop and was known as “Old
Tallow Weight,” doing a brisk business in such
tops and the whip-cord necessary to spin them.
The Rev. E. D. Stone (<a href="#Page_61">see page 61</a>) says that
in his day, under Hawtrey, backgammon and
knuckle bones were popular in College.</p>

<p>About 1770 the games<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> popular at Eton were
“Cricket, Fives, Shirking Walls, Scrambling Walls,
Bally-cally, Battledores, Pegtop, Peg in the ring,
Goals, Hopscotch, Heading, Conquering Lobs,
Hoops, Marbles, Trap-ball, Steal-baggage, Puss in
the corner, Cat-gallows, Kites, Cloyster and Flyer
gigs, Tops, Humming-Tops, Hunt the Hare, Hunt
the dark lanthorn, Chuck, Sinks, Store-Caps, Hustle-cap.”
Of football, it will be observed, there is no
mention; nevertheless it was played, though not in
very good repute. Fives, of course, was then played
between the buttresses of the Chapel, the favourite
time being before eleven-o’clock school, when a
ring of spectators would assemble to watch good
players. As every one knows, the pepper-box of
the modern fives court takes its origin from the
stone termination of the steps leading up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Chapel door, which was copied in the first regular
fives court built at Eton in 1847.</p>

<p>It would seem that the old Eton authorities,
whilst not disapproving of games, did not
attach any very considerable importance to them.
In theory, indeed, boating on the Thames was
forbidden, but in practice even Keate tolerated
the joys of the river, though he made violent
efforts to prevent any rowing before Easter, in
order to prevent the boys from catching chills.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOCKEY</div>

<p>In the ’forties of the last century foot races and
the three-mile steeplechase, with its almost impossible
jumps and immersions, were a source of
considerable interest just before Easter. The
winter games were then football and hockey, the
latter of which, however, only held its ground for
a time, during which it was patronised by many of
the swells. There was then a tradition, which
still seems to exist, that it had been from time to
time forbidden as dangerous; nevertheless it was
played for years without either injury or any
reprimand. The sticks were not rough, but
smoothed and artificially bent, with blades about
a foot long. There were two clubs, called upper
and lower hockey; but football gradually superseded
it, and the game entirely disappeared about
the year 1853. With regard to the prohibition, a
writer mentions (in 1832) hockey and football as
the chief winter games at Eton, and says that more
came away “hobbling” from the latter than from
the former, but speaks further on of a boy having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
in his room “an illegal hockey-stick.” He observes
that this fine old game had died out in
England, except at Eton and Sandhurst, and adds
quaintly: “It is one of the most elegant and
gentlemanly exercises, being susceptible of very
graceful attitudes, and requiring great speed of
foot.”</p>

<p>As time went on, athletics began to exercise
more and more influence, till in the ’sixties they
attained to much the same preponderant position
as they hold at Eton to-day. A few, however,
viewed the growing worship of skilfully trained
brute force with unconcealed dislike. In the early
’seventies of the last century a little magazine,
called the <cite>Adventurer</cite>, contained an article signed
E. G. R. called “Eton as it is,” which scathingly
attacked the growing deification of muscle rather
than brain:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“While in the world around us, for which we are here
preparing ourselves, a vast worship of intellect universally
prevails, at Eton it is the worship of the body which
enslaves the whole community. What, in our estimation,
is mind, intellect, hard and successful cultivation of the
faculties? Nothing. What is cricket, rowing, athletics,
football? Everything. And our School is meanwhile
being degraded almost to the level of an Athletic Club....
Idleness holds sway everywhere, and <em>such</em> idleness! As a man
who has never had dealings with the Chinese can have but
a faint idea of what swindling is, so a man who has never
been at Eton has but a poor conception of what idleness is.”</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">“POP”</div>

<p>This protest was not, however, well received by
the school, the <cite>Adventurer</cite> being expelled from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the rooms of “Pop,” which, curiously enough, on
its foundation in 1811 by Charles Fox Townshend
as a political and literary society, had only elected
the captain of the boats in order to show that the
members <em>had no prejudice</em> against athletics.</p>

<p>Its tone was distinctly Conservative. Fourteen
years later, in Mr. Gladstone’s day, only one
member, a Colleger, was suspected of having Liberal
tendencies. Originally “Pop” was located in the
upper room of Mother Hatton’s “sock shop.” In
1846, when the house, together with another,
was formed into Drury’s, “Pop” migrated to the
yard of the old Christopher. The site of Drury’s
is now covered by part of that huge and incongruous
building&mdash;the “Memorial Hall.”</p>

<p>The early members of “Pop,” it is curious to
find, were originally known as the Literati, their
first debate, held on February 9, 1811, dealing with
the question of whether the passage of the Andes
by Pizarro or the passage of the Alps by Hannibal
was the greater exploit. No political event within
fifty years was permitted as a subject for debate.
Mr. Gladstone, who was elected a member in
1825, made his maiden speech before this Society,
the subject being “Is the Education of the Poor
on the whole Beneficial?”</p>

<p>The future Prime Minister took great pains
to improve himself as an orator, going, it is
said, to rehearse his “Pop” speeches in Trotman’s
gardens, on the site of which the old fives courts
were afterwards built. To the end of his days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
he continued to take great interest in the “Eton
Society.” His correspondence as to its records, in
which every speaker has written his speech, has
been amusingly described by Lord Rosebery, who
on succeeding the great statesman in office one
day received a letter in which the Grand Old Man
expressed himself much distressed because during
a recent visit to the rooms of “Pop” he had seen
a picture of a recent Derby winner over the
chimney-piece. A generation, wrote Mr. Gladstone,
which had such depraved tastes could not,
in his opinion, be fitted to have the custody of
the invaluable records of the Eton Society, and he
therefore begged Lord Rosebery to address the
authorities at Eton on the subject. The state of
affairs of which Mr. Gladstone complained, did
not cause the recipient of his appeal so much
disquiet, for the Derby winner which hung over
the “Pop” mantelpiece was Lord Rosebery’s
own horse, Ladas, which won the great classic
race in 1894.</p>

<p>Lord Rosebery, who, even in his Eton days,
was a most effective debater, is another member
of “Pop” who has risen to high distinction. Retaining
a singularly keen interest in everything
connected with his old school, he it was who made
the most eloquent and witty speech at the dinner
in the Memorial Hall, where, on July 14, 1911,
400 Etonians, the vast majority old members of
“Pop,” met to commemorate the 100th anniversary
of the Society’s foundation. In the aforesaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
speech he very happily described “Pop” as being a
noble companionship like the Garter, not always
given for merit, but a high companionship with
illustrious tradition to which anybody might be
proud to belong.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ETON VICEROYS</div>

<p>Though athleticism has now in a great measure
dominated the “Eton Society,” it must be confessed,
as another distinguished old Etonian, Lord
Curzon, said at the same dinner, that neither title,
means, nor athletic distinction <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</i> ever enabled a
man to get inside the walls of “Pop.” There must
be something else&mdash;he must be what the world
calls “a good sort,” and it is well that this happy
state of affairs still remains unchanged. On the
same occasion Lord Curzon pointed out that Eton
had laid a vigorous hand on India, six out of the
last seven Viceroys having been old Eton boys,
whilst that illustrious veteran Lord Roberts was
also an old Etonian.</p>

<p>In the course of the nineteenth century the
importance of the captain of the boats has gradually
grown, and at the present day his personality
dominates Eton. He occupies a unique position,
being envied and admired by the Upper part of
the school and regarded as a sort of superior
being by Lower boys.</p>

<p>When, about half a century ago, a Royal Commission
was taking evidence as to the state of
affairs prevailing at Eton, it was elicited in evidence
that “the captains of the boats and the eleven were
scarcely ever distinguished in scholarship or mathematics.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
One master indeed declared that he had
“not observed any boys, during a short experience,
distinguished both in intellect and athletic
pursuits.” Young Lord Boringdon, himself one
of the “eight” for two years, was “afraid that the
crews of the boats were generally distinguished for
want of industrious habits.” Cricket the Commission
pronounced to have been found “hardly
compatible with high scholarship.” Although the
Collegers formed the larger proportion of the
oldest boys in the school, they were seldom in the
eleven, because they were unwilling to spare so
much time from the school work as was considered
necessary for practice.</p>

<p>In my own Eton days, thirty years ago, the
captain of the school&mdash;head of Sixth Form&mdash;was
nobody at all in the eyes of the Oppidans.
Few of them indeed knew him by sight, and fewer
still felt any curiosity to do so. As far as I
remember he enjoyed no particular privileges
except the right of presenting a new Headmaster
with a birch tied up with ribbon of Eton blue.
The captain of the Oppidans held a slightly better
position, a sort of idea prevailing that there must
have been something extraordinary about him or
he would not have risen so high in the school,
Oppidans as a rule not being generally considered
very clever or apt to work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“SWAGGERS”</div>

<p>Next to the captain of the boats in popular
estimation came the captain of the eleven, who in
his own circle commanded a good deal of attention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
and of course stood infinitely higher than any
boy distinguished only for intellectual attainments.
The members of the eight and eleven followed
after, together with a few other “swaggers,” who
on account of their prowess at football, rackets,
running, fives, and sometimes even rifle shooting,
were regarded with a certain degree of reverential
awe.</p>

<p>Of late years, however, a more satisfactory state
of affairs has prevailed, not a few prominent athletes
and oarsmen having shown considerable mental
capacity.</p>

<h2>IX<br />
ROWING AND GAMES</h2>


<p>The early history of Eton rowing is somewhat
obscure, but it is perfectly clear that the Oppidans
have always had control of all rowing arrangements.
In former times, indeed, Collegers only
boated below Bridge, and were rarely seen above;
indeed if they did go up stream they were more
than likely to be molested by Oppidans, who
claimed that part of the river as their own watery
domain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BOATS</div>

<p>Though boating must have gone on at Eton
ever since the foundation of the College, there
would appear to have been no attempt at a regular
organisation till the middle of the eighteenth century.
In 1762 there were three long boats, the
“Snake,” the “Piper’s Green,” and “My Guineas
Lion.” Then, as now, a captain of the boats
presided over the crews. In the early days of
Keate’s reign (1811-1814), however, there seem to
have been six boats&mdash;one 10-oar (the “Monarch,”
as now), three 8-oars, and two 6-oars, later on
changed to four 8-oars and one 6-oar. At that
time, as has been the case in later years, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
“Monarch,” though it stood first on the list, and
took precedence of all the other boats, was by
no means the best manned, being, as has been the
case in later years, something of a refuge for
swagger boys who might not be exceptionally fine
oars. For this reason, though it was scarcely
regarded with contempt, yet it could never either
be looked up to as affording a pattern for the other
crews. A place in it, however, was a good thing
to be secured.</p>

<p>In 1829<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> the Upper boats were the “Monarch,”
“Britannia,” and “Etonian”; the Lower, “Victory,”
“Thetis,” “Defiance,” “St. George,” and
“Dreadnought.” The “Thetis,” it should be
added, replaced the “Hibernia,” which disappeared
as the “Trafalgar” had done. In 1830, however,
one of the Lower boats was called the “Nelson.”
At that time, it should be added, the Lower boats
were made up of Lower boys and Fifth Form
indiscriminately. The revival of the “Nelson” in
1830 was due to a revolt of the Lower boys in
a dame’s house against the Fifth Form, which
ended in the former putting a boat on the river in
order to escape compulsory cricket. The boats
used were clinker built, and either gig or wherry
fashion, the eights mostly of the former. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
had rowlocks, but not outriggers, and must have
been heavy as compared with modern clinker-built
eights. The oars were of the old type, square
loomed, with a button nailed on.</p>

<p>The original practice in the Lower boats was to
employ watermen (known as “cads”) as strokes
and steerers. Jack Haverley, for instance, who in
1861 became the head waterman employed by the
school, steered the “Defiance” as late as 1830.
Another old custom practised on great occasions
was for each boat to have in it some visitor to
Eton. When, as sometimes happened, the honoured
guest chanced to be a demure gentleman in black,
he looked singularly out of place amidst the gay
costumes of the crew. In old-fashioned times this
“sitter,” as he was called, sat in the centre of
the boat to keep it steady, but in later years he
reclined in the stern, usually with a large hamper
of champagne in front of him, it being the custom
for a sitter to make the boys a present of wine.
In those far-distant days little check would seem
to have been placed upon the boys indulging freely
in alcohol. The writer’s uncle, who as Lord
Walpole steered the “Etonian” in 1830, often
told of the glorious bowls of punch which he and
his friends used to consume. From the account
he gave, the Upper boys at least were then allowed
in most respects to do pretty much as they liked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A TRICK</div>

<p>The authorities did not in any way interfere
with anything connected with boating, of the
very existence of which, however, according to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
curious convention, they were supposed to be unaware.
Dr. Keate indeed carried the practice of
ignoring rowing to such an extent that when Eton
beat Westminster at Maidenhead in 1831, he only
heard of it because the news of the victory was
forced upon him. Dr. Hawtrey, however, did recognise
boating as an authorised institution; nevertheless
he did nothing to remove the absurd custom
of regarding boys going to the river as being out
of bounds. In Keate’s day, as has elsewhere been
said, the river was really forbidden before Easter,
owing to an idea that the cold, chilly weather
would produce illness amongst the boys. Some
mischievous “wet bobs,” taking advantage of this
prohibition, in 1829 played an amusing trick on
the masters. The weather just before Easter
happened to be very bad, and “the water” in
consequence was forbidden. Nevertheless, the
boats went up until a grand capture of rebellious
spirits was meditated by the authorities. By some
means this purpose became known, and the wags
masked and dressed up eight “cads” to represent
Upper boys. They had not reached Upper Hope
before the scheme began to take effect. “Foolish
boys! I know you all. Come ashore,” sounded
from one bank. “Come here, or you all will be
expelled,” re-echoed from the other. At last,
after a great deal of shouting and galloping, the
masks were dropped and the joke explained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SURLY HALL</div>

<p>In old days, on certain evenings chosen by the
captain of the boats, the Upper crews had regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
feasts at Surly, known as “Duck and Green Pea”
nights, where there was much conviviality, the
crews being usually elated on the return journey,
on which it was the custom to pull leisurely at first.
As, however, they passed Boveney Church (there
was then no lock) they drew in their oars, and the
watermen who pulled stroke were called on for
songs, which they sang solo, the boys joining in the
chorus. After the watermen were dispensed with,
the same customs continued. This entertainment
was kept up from Boveney to the Rushes, and then
the pulling was “Hard all!” for fear of being late
for Absence, or, as it was then called, for fear of
being “out afresh.” It was on the voyage up,
however, that the rivalry between the boats mostly
took place; but whenever they rowed “Hard all!”
silence was kept, and each boat tried to make a race
of it with the one in front or behind. After the
feast at Surly, songs were sung till the time when
“Oars” was called, when the crews rushed off to
their boats in order to get back before Lock-Up.
The Lower boats, which only escorted the Upper
ones up to Easy Bridge above the Rushes, met
them on their return and took part in the procession
down to the Bridge.</p>

<p>These “Duck and Green Pea” nights afterwards
developed into the “Check” nights (supposed to be
so called from the shirts of the rowers) which Dr.
Goodford abolished in 1860. “Check” nights took
place on every alternate Saturday after the 4th of
June, at the end of the summer half, and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
last the crews of the Upper boats maintained the
traditional fare of duck and green peas for which
Surly Hall was celebrated. The old place, which
saw so many generations of Etonians swallow
copious libations of champagne, though it long
survived the abolition of “Check” nights, is now
itself but a memory of the past, having been pulled
down in 1902.</p>

<p>In former days, on such evenings as boat-racing
had taken place, Eton was very lively indeed, the
crews on their way home stopping to drink the
winners’ healths at the Christopher, and then
walking down arm-in-arm until they reached the
school, where a crowd had collected. As in later
times, the winners were “hoisted” and carried along
by the wall amidst cheers. Windsor Bridge was
then the winning-post of all races, the starting-point
as a rule, it would appear, the Firework Eyot, which
in old maps figures as Cooper’s Ait. The races, it
should be added, were always for money, a good
part of which in all probability was spent in drink.</p>

<p>The 4th of June and Election Saturday were
celebrated by the Procession of Boats in gala dress
and by fireworks from the Eyot. Previous to 1814
all the rowers in each boat had a fancy dress
appropriate to the boat. In after years the crews
wore blue jackets with anchors embroidered on the
outside arm, clad in which they pulled all the way
up to Surly. In 1828 checked shirts were introduced,
and this fashion has continued ever since.
On special days the boats had tillers fashioned as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
serpents, and garlanded with oak leaves, instead of
the ordinary wooden tiller or the rudder lines and
yokes which they used in the races. On the 4th
of June and on Election Saturday the crews donned
a special costume, the main features of which were
a dark-blue jacket with brass buttons, hanging loose
in front in order to show the distinctive pattern of
the shirt, over which the silken handkerchief worn
round the neck hung. Up to about 1828 the coxswains
of boats on such great days wore fancy
costumes, but after that date every coxswain was
dressed as a naval officer, increasing in rank according
to the precedence to which his boat was entitled,
and this custom is still followed on the 4th of June.
A somewhat curious coincidence in connection
with the boats is that Lord Rosebery, Lord St.
Aldwyn, and Lord Coventry in their Eton days all
rowed bow in the <em>Monarch</em>&mdash;the ten-oar which
seems always to have been one of the boats.</p>

<p>The great event for Eton oarsmen was formerly
the annual race against Westminster, which in the
early part of the nineteenth century excited the
greatest interest. The proceedings in connection
with the selection of the eight which was to try
conclusions with the London school provoked much
the same interest and enthusiasm as that now
evoked with regard to the Eton crew to be sent to
Henley. The series of contests with Westminster
seems to have commenced in 1829 with a race for
£100 a side. A regular course of training was
always undergone, and for a number of years the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
match was the great event of the summer half.
As time went on, however, it was discontinued,
though revived in 1860 as part of certain
concessions made by the then headmaster, Dr.
Goodford, in consideration of the abolition of
“Check” nights and “Oppidan Dinner.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“OPPIDAN DINNER”</div>

<p>“Oppidan Dinner” was a survival of the
eighteenth century, and seemingly originated at
the old Christopher. In later days, however, it
was held at the White Hart at Windsor, the
number of boys sitting down being usually about
fifty, each of whom paid something like eighteen
shillings a head, which charge included wine.
The time for this dinner was at the end of the
summer half, and those who took part in it
were members of the Upper boats’ eleven and
Sixth Form and a few other Upper boys. The
captain of the boats managed everything, and sat
at the head of the long table in a room which
stretched right through the inn, one end looking
out upon the castle. The dinner began at four in
the afternoon, an adjournment to Eton taking
place for six o’clock Absence, after which, about
6.30, the boys returned to the White Hart for what
was called “dessert,” though every one expected
to drink rather than to eat. The chief show on the
table consisted of decanters and glasses, all of a very
cheap sort, it being well understood that few would
survive the wholesale breakage which almost
invariably followed the annual feast. Toasts were
then given, the captain of the boats rising first of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
all to propose “The Queen.” This was drunk
standing, amidst an accompaniment of cheers.
“The Prince of Wales and the rest of the Royal
Family” followed, after which the boys waited
eagerly for the toasts which had more immediate
reference to their own particular interests and the
songs which formed part of the evening’s programme.
The proceedings invariably closed with
“Floreat Etona,” the drinking of which was the
signal for breaking up. This toast not unnaturally
evoked wild enthusiasm, and at one time it was the
custom for every one to fling their glasses down
and dash them to pieces on the table. About
half-past eight the diners returned to Eton in
very hilarious mood, the captain of the boats and
other popular athletes being generally subjected to
a very enthusiastic “hoisting.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHANGES</div>

<p>The Eton authorities, though perfectly aware
of this somewhat Bacchanalian feast, never took
any notice of it till it was abolished in 1860. As,
however, old drinking customs decreased, it
became clear that Oppidan Dinner was destined to
disappear, and its existence was threatened years
before it was done away with. It was notorious
that as a result of this banquet a number of boys
came to Absence in a very fuddled condition, and
the headmaster, when calling over the names, had
to keep his eyes well fixed on the list for fear of
seeing behaviour of which he would have been
obliged to take notice. At Lock-Up time things
were worse still, and of the reeling crowd who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
surged down the High Street some occasionally
became so violent that it took six or seven boys
to get them to bed.</p>

<p>The last Oppidan Dinner of 1859, however, was
by all accounts the most sober on record. Indeed
an aged waiter at the White Hart was moved
almost to tears at the small amount which had been
drunk. Those who took part in it were of more
serious disposition and mind than their rollicking
predecessors of former days, and most people
agreed that the dinner had become an anachronism.
When, however, in the following year R. H.
Blake-Humfrey, captain of the boats, in unison
with the present Provost, Mr. Warre (who had
then just come to Eton as a master), concurred
in its suppression, not a few were taken by surprise,
whilst many an old Etonian of the old school shook
his head and murmured that Eton was going to
the dogs.</p>

<p>In return for the abolition of “Oppidan Dinner”
and “Check” nights, it was agreed that the eight
should be allowed annually to row at Henley,
whilst “boating bills” were instituted so as to put
aquatics on the same footing as cricket with respect
to exemptions from six o’clock Absence. It was
also laid down that, on days in the summer half
when there was no five o’clock school, the crews of
two eight oars should be excused from “Absence”
on condition of their undertaking to row to within
sight of Cookham Lock. The “strokes” of the
two boats were made responsible, on their words of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
honour, to see that the conditions were fulfilled.
In addition to this, the whole of the High Street,
as far as Windsor Bridge, was placed within bounds,
so that boys going to the “Brocas” or returning
from it were no longer obliged to “shirk” when
they met masters. Finally the annual boat race
with Westminster was to be revived. That very
year a race was duly rowed between Eton and
Westminster at Putney, in which Eton won very
easily. There was, however, nothing extraordinary
about this, for since the old days when Eton and
Westminster had been rival schools the former had
greatly increased in size. Westminster had in
reality barely a chance, for it had been only with
considerable difficulty that an eight had been got
together at all. Though some of the Westminster
oars were good men, the crews that rowed against
Eton from 1860 to 1864 were entirely outmatched
in weight and strength. In addition to which,
in 1861 and 1862 the Eton eight possessed a tower
of strength in their captain and stroke, Mr. R. H.
Blake-Humfrey, who, it should be added, has, in his
introduction to the <cite>Eton Boating Book</cite>, given such
a clear and excellent account of the early history
of Eton rowing. The race between the two
schools did not take place in 1863; instead, the
Westminster boys came down to Eton on Election
Saturday and had supper with the Eton crews in
the meadow opposite Surly Hall. Rowing back to
Windsor, the visitors very nearly became involved
in what might have been a serious catastrophe, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the cox of the Westminster eight, not being used
to the river, steered the wrong side of the posts
above Boveney Lock, and but for the warning
shout of the steerer of the Eton eight, the Westminster
boat would probably have gone over the
Weir. The match of 1864, in which Eton won
by 27 seconds, was the last occasion upon which
the two eights met. Since then the schools have
developed in different directions, with the result
that the old cordial relations are now in all
probability for ever at an end.</p>

<p>Modern Eton has produced several famous oarsmen&mdash;notably
Mr. S. D. Muttlebury, whose first
triumph was winning the “Lower boy pulling” with
S. S. Sharpe in 1881. The present boating colours
are the Eight, Upper Boat Choices, Upper Boats,
Lower Boat Choices, Lower Boats, the latter of
which all adopted the old Defiance colour in 1885.
For this and other information I have to thank Mr.
F. F. V. Scrulton, the present captain of the boats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SWIMMING</div>

<p>Swimming has always been in great favour with
Eton boys, but in old days the authorities paid no
attention to it, and no effort was made to check
boys who could not swim from risking their lives.
There appears, however, to have been some regular
bathing-place as long ago as 1529, for it is
chronicled that in that year a boy was drowned at
“le watering place,” the site of which, however, is
unknown. The first teacher apparently was a
Frenchman named Champeau, nicknamed by the
boys Slipgibbet, who about 1829 taught swimming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
with corks, which state of affairs continued till all
unauthorised teachers of natation were swept away.
Champeau, also playfully known as Shampoo, gave
his lessons at the spot opposite to “Athens.”
The old Frenchman must have been a competent
teacher, for three miles was often accomplished
by some of his pupils, and headers off Windsor
Bridge were not uncommon. Nevertheless, fatal
accidents intermittently occurred. In the early
part of the nineteenth century a boy was drowned
close to Boveney Meads, in the presence of many big
schoolfellows, of whom not one could dive to bring
up the body, though it could be plainly seen by
those who stooped over the sides of the boats&mdash;fortunately
at that time broad of beam, otherwise
more boys would probably have perished. Sixty or
seventy years earlier young Barnard (afterwards
Dr. Barnard, Headmaster and Provost) had only
escaped a watery grave owing to the successful
efforts of his schoolfellow, Jacob Bryant, a delicate
boy but a good swimmer. In later years Bryant
became a scholar and philologist well in advance of
his age. The average of deaths from drowning
was once, it is said, about one boy in three years.
This bad state of affairs was ended in 1840 when
George Augustus Selwyn, with William Evans,
organised swimming and instituted the “passing”
at “Cuckoo Weir,” which has now become one of
the regular features of a “wet bob’s” career.</p>

<p>The Upper Collegers at one time bathed at the
oak in the playing fields, the Lower at a spot not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
far away, which bore the significant name of
“Deadman’s Hole.” Near by was the old wharf,
done away with in 1840, where the Collegers used
to keep their boats. In those days, however, they
went but little on the river, preferring to concentrate
their energies in preparing for the annual
matches at cricket and football with the Oppidans.
The rivalry was then very keen, and in winter was
even shown by fierce snowball fights, in which both
sides often suffered severely. It may seem strange
that seventy boys could face six hundred, but some
of the biggest boys in the school were Collegers,
as they were not superannuated until they were
nineteen.</p>

<p>About 1828 the annual matches, both at cricket
and football, between the Oppidans and Collegers
were done away with. They were always the most
stoutly contested games of the year, and put both
parties on their mettle far beyond the excitement
of any other match. A good deal of bitterness
was sometimes displayed, and now and then a
smack on the head or a designed “shin” were
given and received; but, on the whole, these
matches did something to draw Oppidans and
Collegers together, and their abolition is to be
deplored, though, in the present age, the great
excess of Oppidans would, it must be confessed,
have rendered their continuance difficult.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ST. ANDREW’S DAY</div>

<p>Of all the various contests which formerly took
place between Collegers and Oppidans the annual
match at the wall on St. Andrew’s Day alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
survives, and has lost none of its interest, though
the two elevens are chosen from seventy Collegers
and from close on a thousand Oppidans. In
reality the chances of victory are in a great degree
equalised owing to the fact that whilst the Collegers
have every opportunity of playing the game during
the whole of the time&mdash;usually about six years&mdash;during
which they remain at Eton, only a small
number of Oppidans play at all till within two
years of their leaving school. It would here be
superfluous to enter upon any detailed description
of the game. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>THE “WALL”<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Suffice it to say that it is played
within a narrow strip of ground some twenty feet
wide and close up against the old wall built in
1717, the goals being the tree with a white mark
at the end towards Slough, and the door of
Weston’s Yard at the Eton end. The origin of
this peculiar form of football is very obscure.
Mr. E. C. Benthall, K.S., Keeper of the Wall
in the present year, 1911, who has most obligingly
furnished me with some interesting information,
believes that it originated from “passage football,”
and doubts if it was ever played very seriously
till about one hundred years ago, at which time
it was an entirely different game from what it is
now. In spite of its quaint terms, it would seem
to be of no great antiquity, at least in anything
like its present form. The wall itself dates from
1717, but about the earliest record of any regular
game there dates from the first decade of the
nineteenth century, at which time any one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
chose seems to have been allowed to play, with
the result that there were usually eighteen or
twenty a side. It was then practically the only
form of football popular at Eton, though occasionally
something approaching to the modern “Field
Game” was played in the open. Till 1841, however,
such forms of relaxation were discouraged
by the masters. Nevertheless, on the piece
of grass between the path and the river in
Lower Club the Collegers, up till about 1863,
played a variety known as “Lower College.”
This was probably a link between the field and
wall games, for it had “shies” and “goals.” In
early days the wall game was played on a much
wider strip of ground than is at present the case.
The bully was not its essential feature, and the ball
was often run down the whole length of the wall.
Sixty years or so ago matches of Dames <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">v.</i> Tutors
were occasionally played, and during one of these
the ball somehow was pitched right on the top of
the wall, along which it ran for some eight yards
before coming to a dead standstill on the top.</p>

<p>The rules were then, of course, more elastic
than those now in use, and since they were
drawn up in 1849 the game has undergone
various minor changes, including the curtailment
of the space at the wall to its present limits and
the toleration (about 1851) of “furking” the ball
back in calx.</p>

<p>At one time considerable savagery seems to
have been displayed by the rival teams, in consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
of which Dr. Hawtrey once suspended
all play for three weeks, and in 1851 it was
actually proposed to abolish the annual match on
St. Andrew’s Day on account of the ill-feeling
which was said to be engendered between Oppidans
and Collegers. Of late years, however, the
historic contest is remarkable for the good-humour
shown by both sides. A quaint figure at the
annual match from 1847 up to 1888, the year before
he fell ill, was old Powell, whose old-fashioned
velveteen coat and high top-hat were survivals of
another age. During his long superintendence
of the wall he had seen many generations of
Collegers and Oppidans contending for goals and
shies. After ten years of confinement and suffering
he died in 1899.</p>

<p>The wall game is as different from any other
form of football as it is possible to imagine. To
one unacquainted with its intricacies, nothing can
be more curious than the bully close up against
the wall, and the efforts of those forming it to
prevent kicks sending the ball out&mdash;that is to say,
beyond the line marked as the limit within which
play takes place. The rules really amount to a
sort of complicated creed, which has been handed
on from one generation of Collegers to another.
A good deal of the game is mystifying to a
spectator unacquainted with its intricacies. A
“calx bully,” for instance, is highly difficult to
explain, whilst the necessary preliminaries for a
“shy” at goals are often, owing to the confusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of the struggle, visible only to the umpire. The
summit of a wall-player’s ambition is to throw a
“goal,” which feat, in the annual St. Andrew’s Day
match, has only been accomplished three times
within the last hundred years&mdash;in every case by
a Colleger. W. Marcon threw one in 1842,
when College won by a goal and 19 shies, 17 of
which were got by H. Phillott in rapid succession.
H. J. Mordaunt, captain of the eleven in 1886,
threw another in 1885, when he hit the door just
at the bottom. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>A HISTORIC GOAL<span class="hidev">|</span></span> The name of this fine athlete,
the writer (who knew him at Eton) is informed,
is still a household word in College, where his
goal is held in greater reverence than that scored
in 1909. Mordaunt’s was an unaided effort, whilst
the latter seems to have been rather lucky. Nevertheless,
Finlay and Creasy deserved the greatest
credit for their presence of mind. In 1858, it
should be added, a throw by Hollingworth was
disputed.</p>

<p>Though of all pastimes the wall game is least
adapted for summer, time-honoured usage prescribed&mdash;and
after a discontinuance for four years
now once again prescribes&mdash;that at six o’clock on
the morning of Ascension Day a mixed team
of Collegers and Oppidans should meet at the
“Wall.” The origin of this custom I have been
unable to ascertain. Like the game played on
the last evening of last summer half, it probably
took its rise from boyish enthusiasm.</p>

<p>In connection with the wall game, the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
of James Kenneth Stephen&mdash;the gifted J. K. S.,
who in his prime was so unfortunately snatched
away by death&mdash;will never be forgotten. Captain
of the College team in 1876-1877, he was a great
supporter of “noster ludus muralis,” as he has
left on record in his “Quo Musa Tendis,” one
stanza of which runs&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentbase">There’s another wall with a field beside it,
</div><div class="indentone">A wall not wholly unknown to fame,
</div><div class="indentbase">For a game’s played there which most who’ve tried it
</div><div class="indentone">Declare is a truly noble game.
</div></div></div></div>

<p>College, it is pleasant to know, seems unlikely
ever to forget this true son of Eton, for on the
evening of St. Andrew’s Day each of the wall
team in turn drinks “In piam memoriam, J. K. S.,”
every raising of the cup as it is passed around being
followed by a cheer.</p>

<p>A brilliant young contemporary of J. K. S.
who played at the wall in 1880 is happily still
left to us. This is Mr. A. C. Benson, whose fine
intellect and delightful achievements in the fields
of literature have rendered his name well known
to that greater public which joins with Etonians
in admiration of his work.</p>

<p>College may well be proud of having produced
two such men as these.</p>

<p>Till the middle of the fifties in the last century
the wall game was also played at the red brick
wall in front of the boys’ entrance to the house
which about 1790 was built overlooking the
Timbralls. For nearly a quarter of a century after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
play had ceased to take place there, the calces
marked in chalk could still be discerned. The
field game is a rather modern institution. As
has before been said, ordinary football does not
seem to have been very popular amongst Etonians
of a hundred years ago, though in the last
century it gradually rose in favour. A curious
character of other days was old Strugnal, who
was celebrated for tightening the bladder of a
football by means of blowing through a piece of
tobacco pipe placed in his mouth. On the whole,
the annals of Eton football, a primitive form of
which in the eighteenth century was known as
“goals,” with the exception of some exciting house
matches, do not possess any great interest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CRICKET</div>

<p>Cricket, unlike football, was popular at Eton
over two hundred years ago, having been played
as early as 1706, and in high favour in Horace
Walpole’s day. About the first great Etonian
cricketer was the eighth Lord Winchilsea, who
afterwards became chief patron of the famous
Hambledon Club. At one time he made an
attempt to introduce an innovation by increasing
the stumps to four, but the change was never
popular, though in the match between the
Gentlemen and Players in 1837, in order to equalise
the contest, the latter undertook to defend four
stumps instead of three. In 1751 three matches
for £1500 were played between the Gentlemen of
England and Eton College, Past and Present; the
former won the stakes, winning two out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
three matches. The players were dressed in silk
jackets, trousers, and velvet caps. In 1791 Lord
Winchilsea made 54 runs in a contest between
Old Etonians <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">versus</i> the Gentlemen of England.
This was played at old “Lord’s,” where Dorset
Square now stands. In the same year the school
beat the Maidenhead Club by four wickets. Keate
was one of the seven Collegers playing, and
scored 0 and 4, while in the second innings
Way “nipped himself out” for 11. Five years
later a match seems to have taken place against
Westminster on Hounslow Heath, in defiance
of the Headmaster’s strict orders; it resulted
in the defeat of Eton and the flogging of all the
Eleven!</p>

<p>In those days there was a good deal of jollity in
connection with the cricket in the playing fields,
and the boys were allowed to do many things
which would be thought very reprehensible to-day.
Up to about 1827, for instance, a beer tent used
to be allowed when cricket matches were played.
Two or three years later Eton cricket for some
reason or other admittedly deteriorated, a disastrous
state of affairs which was thus explained by one of
the “cads” who used to hover about the shooting
fields: “Lord, sir, they never has won a match
since the beer tent got the sack, and never will no
more.” This tent, where “beer and baccy” were
the order of the day before it gave offence to the
higher powers, was kept, at every match, by the
veteran Jem Miller for the accommodation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the “cads,” Broconalian Club, and other loungers,
and loudly and lustily did they cheer the boys with
their stentorian lungs. It was from this tent that
one of the best bowlers and batters Eton ever
produced&mdash;in after years a prominent divine at
King’s&mdash;was encouraged by the deafening shouts
of “Goo it, my dear Harding; goo it, my dear boy,”
when he scored 86 runs off his own bat against
Messrs. Ward, Vigne, Tanner, and others of the
Epsom Club. It was on this memorable day, too,
that he made a tremendous hit over the shooting-field
trees, high in the air, of course, when a
bargeman from the tent, lost in amazement at the
hit, thundered out, “There she goes for Chessy
[Chertsey] Church, by Jingo!” it being a prominent
mark on the river for the bargees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“WATER BOILS,” “MAKE TEA”</div>

<p>According to all accounts, cricket in those less
strenuous days was not taken any too seriously.
Boys did not change their clothing to play it,
though they did so for football. Once during a
match in Upper Club a fight was reported to be
going on in the playing fields, and in a few
minutes gentlemen, spectators, and cricketers not
actually playing scampered over Sheep’s Bridge,
eager to witness the contest. Formerly tea in
Upper Club was made by fags. The well-known
cries of “Water boils!” “Make tea!” originated
during this now obsolete state of affairs.</p>

<p>Though all Bacchanalian gaiety had disappeared
from the playing fields by the middle of the last
century, a somewhat free-and-easy spirit still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
prevailed, and on the occasion of school matches
there was usually a good deal of fun, especially
when Billy Boland&mdash;a celebrated character and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon vivant</i> of the past, who was supposed to have
been the original of Fred Bayham in Thackeray’s
novel of <cite>The Newcomes</cite>&mdash;was present. He it was
who once, after lunch during a cricket match
between the school and I Zingari, presented
Dr. Hawtrey, the then headmaster, with the
Freedom of the Club in a deal box, and wound
up a mock speech with the toast: “Floreat Etona
et vivat ‘Nitidissimus’ Hawtrey!” This was
peculiarly appropriate, for with his velvet-collared
coat the Doctor was the smartest of men and wore
the best-varnished boots in the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FIRST MATCH AT LORD’S</div>

<p>The first regular match played by Eton against
a public school appears to have taken place in 1799,
when an Eton eleven met Westminster at old
Lord’s. On this occasion Eton in their innings
made only 47 runs. Westminster then went in and
scored 13, when the stumps were drawn, with five
wickets to fall. The match was said to be “postponed,”
but there is no account to be found of
its ever having been resumed. Next year Eton
had an easy victory, making a score of 213 in
one innings, against Westminster’s 54 and 31.
Curiously enough, the Collegers at that time
constituted the strength of the eleven and made
the biggest scores. Benjamin Drury, afterwards
an assistant master, Joseph Thackeray, and Thomas
Lloyd, elder brother of the bishop, were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
bowlers. Poor Lloyd, who beat the Westminster
innings off his own bat, died after the holidays
from the effects of a chill which he caught during
the match. This would seem to have been the last
match with Westminster.</p>

<p>The first Eton and Harrow contest took place
in 1805 at Lord’s, when Eton won in a single
innings. On this occasion Byron made 7 and 2
for the beaten school. Eight of the winning
eleven (among whom was Lord Stratford de
Redcliffe) were King’s scholars. After this no
authentic record exists of any match till 1818,
when Harrow beat Eton. Apparently the whole
thing was rather a fiasco; only two of the best
Eton men were present at Lord’s, the rest of the
eleven being made up of such Etonians as could be
collected on the ground. In the following year,
however, Eton beat Harrow in one innings; in
1822 Harrow beat Eton. In 1832 Eton scored
a great triumph, beating Harrow and Winchester
each in one innings. The match of 1841 was
remarkable for the great innings of Emilius Bayley,
who made 153, up to then the highest score ever
achieved by any player in a public school match.
Oddly enough, however, that same year Eton
was beaten hollow by Winchester. In 1846
Eton repeated the great performance of 1832
and again vanquished Harrow and Winchester
each in a single innings. One of the eleven on
this occasion was J. W. Chitty (in after life
the Rt. Hon. Lord Justice Chitty), who played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
four years for Eton, in the last of which&mdash;1847&mdash;he
was captain of the eleven.</p>

<p>A great character well known to Eton cricketers
of the forties was M’Niven minor, who, Mr.
Coleridge declares, in his interesting recollections,
was in Sixth Form, the football team, and the
eight, as well as in the eleven. Commonly called
“Snivey,” this fine athlete seems to have been
very notorious for his wild eccentricities and
oddities of dress, which, however, in nowise
impaired a universal popularity.</p>

<p>During the fifties of the last century Eton
cricket was not in a very flourishing state. The
smart thing was to be in the boats, and “dry-bobs”
were rather looked down upon till 1860, when
a strenuous effort began to be made to end the
long series of reverses which the school had sustained
in its annual matches against Harrow.
The engagement of a professional cricketer and
improvements in Upper Club aroused great interest,
and so much excitement was the result that when
in that year Eton made rather a good fight at
Lord’s, all sorts of absurd rumours were born of
the indignation provoked by defeat. It was said,
for instance, that Daniel, the Harrow captain,
was really a professional in disguise&mdash;this was
because he wore whiskers and a straw hat!</p>

<div class="sidenote">“POCKETS”</div>

<p>In 1861, when the late Mr. R. A. H. Mitchell,
who afterwards as a master did so much for
Eton cricket, was captain, the match was unfinished,
and only in the next year did Eton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
score its first victory against Harrow since 1850.
The finish (like that of 1910) gave rise to much
excitement, and feeling ran very high, both sides
indulging in merciless chaff. The report that
the Harrow headmaster&mdash;Dr. Butler&mdash;had shortly
before issued an order that all side-pockets were
to be sewn up, with a view to prevent slouching,
gave the Eton boys an opportunity of which
they were not slow to take advantage, and
accordingly the ground resounded with yells of
“Pockets” throughout the day. The hero of
the day was A. S. Teape, whose bowling did so
much to win the match, at the close of which
he was accorded an enthusiastic ovation. A large
proportion of the spectators were quite carried
away by excitement, and several fights took
place between members of the rival schools,
whilst two well-known Eton and Harrow “cads,”
both pretty well “sprung,” started a little mill
on their own account, much to the amusement
of the onlookers. Probably the encounter was
a prearranged affair, for the old rascals took
good care not to hurt each other, and reaped
a considerable harvest by sending the hat round
afterwards. One of the winning team that
year was Mr. Alfred Lubbock, the great Eton
cricketer who became captain in 1863, in
which year he made the magnificent score of 174,
not out, against Winchester. Every old Etonian
should read the book written by him some little
time ago, one chapter of which was contributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
by his son, Mr. Robin Lubbock, K.S., a member
of the eleven of 1896-1897. A young man of
high promise, he most unfortunately met with an
early death through a sad accident in the hunting-field.
The names of Lubbock, Lyttelton, and
Studd will always be associated with the history
of Eton cricket. For six successive years&mdash;1861
to 1866&mdash;there was always a Lubbock in the eleven,
whilst three Lytteltons (one of whom was the
present Headmaster) played at Lord’s in 1872,
and three Studds in 1877.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A CURIOUS “RAG”</div>

<p>In former days there was often much rowdiness
after an Eton and Harrow match, which, for some
unknown reason, seemed to send a certain amount
of hot-blooded youngsters almost mad. In the
early eighties of the last century the present writer
witnessed a curious development of this spirit.
Returning to Eton in the evening after the match
was over, he found himself in a railway carriage
filled with a number of boys he did not know,
together with one old Etonian, apparently a newly
joined subaltern of some cavalry regiment. For a
little time after the train had started the party
more or less calmly discussed the match, but all of a
sudden the old Etonian, who was in a most excited
state, began to smash up the carriage, tearing
down the hat-racks and breaking the windows,
in which work of destruction he was cheerfully
seconded by his companions, who eventually, when
the train came to the bridge over the river near
Windsor, threw most of the cushions and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
advertisement placards, which they had wrenched
off, into the river. The writer was the more
struck by this scene on account of the party not
in any way suggesting that he should join in
it; and as a matter of fact, reading a paper and
smoking (nearly every boy then smoked when
going to or leaving Eton), he sat undisturbed upon
the only cushion not thrown out of window.
He was a very small boy at the time, and the
wreckers, who were big ones, treated him throughout
with great courtesy. The damage, owing
to the great crowd of boys returning to Eton,
was apparently not discovered by the station
officials on the arrival of the train at Windsor, nor
was anything heard of it afterwards by the school,
though the writer has reason to believe that some
other carriages were also wrecked on the same
train. In all probability the authorities, aware of
the impossibility of detecting the offenders, preferred
to let the whole matter rest. It was a
curious instance of the passion for destruction
which occasionally takes possession of youth.</p>

<p>The first match between Eton and Winchester
seems to have been played in 1826, when Winchester
won. Afterwards, up to 1854, it was
played at Lord’s. Success was pretty evenly
divided till 1845, when a tie produced great interest
and excitement. In that year the late Provost,
Dr. Hornby, was a member of the Eton team.
In old days the Winchester boys played in tall
white beaver hats, but the Etonians wore straw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
In 1856 the match was played at Winchester,
neither school being allowed to come to town, and
since then the elevens have met on the Eton and
Winchester ground alternately.</p>

<p>Sixpenny, which appears to have taken its name
from the Sixpenny Club, founded for Lower boys
by G. J. Boudier, 1832-1838, captain of the eleven,
an Etonian who is said to once have thrashed a
bargee three times his own size, was formerly a
much-coveted Lower boy colour. It was, however,
done away with in 1898, but Upper Sixpenny
is still an important cricket colour for Uppers
who are also Juniors, as it is now the first colour
a young cricketer can obtain at Eton, where, if
you once get a name as a promising bat, bowler,
or field, it is difficult to lose it, whereas if a boy
does not start well, little attention is afterwards
paid to him.</p>

<p>A curious modern Eton cricket institution is
“Second Upper Club,” nominally the second game
in the school, but in reality consisting of Upper
boys who are distinguished in the school, mostly in
some other line than cricket, though a number of
quite good players also belong. A few years ago
some of the games played by Second Upper Club
degenerated into huge “rags,” ending with an early
adjournment to little Brown’s, whence, after a huge
tea had been partaken of, every one went off to
bathe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AGAR’S PLOUGH</div>

<p>A feature of modern Eton is “Agar’s Plough,”
just across Datchet Lane, well laid out for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
purposes of the school games. This large tract
of land was saved from the speculative builder
by purchase in 1895, and here, eight years later,
for the first time was played the Eton and
Winchester match. As a cricket ground Agar’s
Plough possesses several advantages over the
historic Upper Club, known in the distant past
as the Upper Shooting Fields. One of the chief
gains is, of course, the absence of big trees to
confuse the light. Whether, however, Upper Club
is discarded for school matches or not, it will
always remain a hallowed spot in the recollection
of old Etonians who as boys knew it in its summer
glory. Full of picturesque associations and shaded
by stately elms planted in the days of the Commonwealth,
the beautiful old ground has seen many
a generation of Eton boys pass o’er its pleasant
sward of green. Besides Agar’s Plough modern
Eton possesses other facilities for games undreamt
of in less luxurious days. Amongst these are
the new racquets courts near the gasworks which
in 1902-3 took the place of those down Keate’s
Lane.</p>

<p>At the present day there is no tennis at Eton,
but a tennis court appears to have existed between
1600 and 1603, though, curiously enough, its
site has never been ascertained. Near the new
racquets courts thirty-eight new fives courts have
been built since 1870.</p>

<p>The excellent game of fives, which has now
attained a comparatively widespread popularity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
originated in the spaces between the Chapel
buttresses being utilised for play. The one next
the flight of steps, with its so-called pepper-box, is
the model from which all modern fives courts are
built. The first of these were constructed at Eton
in Trotman’s gardens in 1847, and enjoyed great
popularity in their early days. Since, however,
the number of fives courts has been largely augmented,
the old courts seem to have fallen into
great disrepute. In the writer’s day, although
such new courts as existed were naturally the
most in request, boys still ran to obtain one of
the old ones. It was a rule that no court could
be considered taken unless there was some one
actually upon it, to claim it by the right of
occupancy. The consequence was that they
always became the reward of the swift, or of those
who were let out of school earlier than the rest;
keen struggles ensued, and the stream of runners
flying down Keate’s Lane day after day testified
to the eagerness of spirit which could prompt boys
to exhaust themselves merely to obtain the chance
of getting a game. It was then the custom for the
boy first in a court to mark his right of possession by
putting down his hat in it. The original fives
court between the buttresses of the Chapel had
been long unused, though there was sometimes a
knock-up between Lower boys waiting to go into
school.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COLOURS</div>

<p>Colours at Eton, except those of the eleven
and of the eight, which in some form or other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
probably existed as far back as the eighteenth
century, are of modern origin. The parti-coloured
scarlet and Eton blue shirt of the field only dates
from 1860, and the dark blue and red of the wall
from 1861. A year later saw the birth of house
colours. About the same time a great craze for
wearing colours on every possible occasion made
itself felt. In old days boys had been supposed to
shirk masters when in change clothes, but now a
tendency to run into an opposite extreme produced
an agitation in favour of greater laxity regarding
dress. The authorities, however, rightly deeming
that Eton should retain its old traditions as to tall
hats and the like, stood firm, every reasonable
concession having long before that date been
granted. Only quite recently indeed have boys
been allowed to answer their names at Absence in
change clothes, an innovation which many an old
Etonian, mindful of the ancient traditions of the
school, must surely deplore.</p>

<p>This chapter cannot be concluded without some
reference to the Eton Hunt, as the beagles have
sometimes been facetiously called. The pack in
question would appear to have first been started
about 1840 under the auspices of Anstruther-Thompson,
in after life one of the best-known and
most popular Masters of Hounds in England. For
some years later its existence was rather precarious,
at times resembling that of a contemporary
College pack which was once declared to
consist of a single long-backed Scotch terrier.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
From the earliest days of the hunt, however, there
appears to have been some attempt at a regular
organisation. The whips, for instance, had E.C.H.
on the buttons of their coats, which Dr. Hawtrey
(Edward Craven), who of course knew of the existence
of the hunt, though he did not recognise it, interpreted
as a delicate compliment to himself. At
one time the Collegers and Oppidans each had a
separate pack of their own, but these were amalgamated
in 1866.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HYSTERICAL SENTIMENT</div>

<p>Drag hunts were formerly rather popular with
the followers of the Eton beagles, and sometimes
very good runs were enjoyed. One of the “cads”
about the wall, known as Polly Green, an active
fellow who used to go across country uncommonly
well, afforded very good sport. At that time the
beagles had not been recognised by the authorities,
and were kept more or less secretly a good way out
of bounds, in a small kennel at the corner of the
Brocas near the river. Eventually, however, the
pack became known to every one, including the
masters, who, with great good sense, far from
discouraging it, gave it encouragement and approval,
and thereby raised the character of the sport whilst
increasing its popularity in the school. In 1884
the mastership of Lord Newtown-Butler&mdash;now
Major the Earl of Lanesborough&mdash;was particularly
successful, this gallant and popular Guardsman
having ever been the incarnation of geniality and
good-natured fun. There is no need to deal here
with the absurd agitation of so-called humanitarians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
for the pack’s suppression. Suffice it to say that
the greatest credit is due to the present Headmaster
for having refused to listen to the voice of
hysterical sentimentalism. May his successors be
equally firm!</p>

<h2>X<br />
YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY</h2>


<p>The old type of Eton Masters and Fellows is
now practically extinct, but thirty or forty years
ago quite a number of them were still flourishing.
Not a few were quaint and eccentric
figures both in their appearance and their ways.
About the quaintest of all was the Rev. F. E.
Durnford, universally known as “Judy,” who was
Lower master from 1864 to 1877. He has been
aptly described as “a sort of Ancient Mariner in
academic garb,” for he had a strange weather-beaten
aspect, the result, no doubt, of having for
many years battled with successive hordes of
impish Lower boys&mdash;“nahty, nahty boys,” as he
called them&mdash;much of whose time was occupied in
giving the good old man all the trouble they could.
Mr. Durnford, though he could never master the
pronunciation of French, was somewhat fond of
interlarding Gallicisms in his discourse, which, of
course, never failed to arouse unbridled merriment.
He himself was perfectly aware of his imperfections
as a linguist, and would at times attempt to
allay such outbursts by the somewhat pathetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
remark, “Ah, boys, it’s my misfortune, not my
fault.” He was a very good-natured old man,
whose main failing perhaps was being inclined
towards an excess of leniency, in which respect his
successor, the Rev. J. L. Joynes, erred far less.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“OLD JIMMY”</div>

<p>This pedagogue, though the most kindly of
men, would stand no nonsense. Many will remember
him in Lower School, with the picturesque
interior of which, full of old woodwork cut with
the names of vanished generations, his personality
accorded so well. He had rather a peculiar voice,
and pronounced words like “tutor” and “nuisance,”
“tootor” and “noosance.” Rather a better preacher
than most of his colleagues, his sermons in “old
Lower Chapel” were sometimes marked by a
certain originality which caused them to be listened
to with interest and attention. In his school
days “Jimmy Joynes,” or “old Jimmy,” as he
was affectionately called, had been captain of the
College team at the wall and a fine fives player,
and as a master he continued to take great interest
in the latter game, giving a cup to be played for by
the house over which he presided before becoming
Lower Master. In the latter capacity, though
an extremely kind-hearted man, he could, as was
well known to the boys under his charge, be
severe enough upon occasion, and the writer well
remembers seeing him administer what was considered
a tremendous flogging to a delinquent, who
afterwards had a distinguished military career. This
consisted of some thirty-two cuts laid on with two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
birches, to the great astonishment of a number
of Lower boys present at the execution. The
victim, a boy of great pluck, was little disturbed
by this castigation, though it was very much more
serious than most of the many floggings he had
suffered before. As a matter of fact, it was only
the swishings of the Lower master which inflicted
any real physical pain, the few strokes which the
Head, Dr. Hornby, administered being generally
more in the nature of a formal reproof than anything
else&mdash;at least that was the experience of
the present writer, who well remembers that on
retiring from the torture-chamber next Upper
School he reflected that if one was to be flogged at
all, the thing could not be conducted in a more
pleasant and dignified way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. HORNBY</div>

<p>In his relations with the boys Dr. Hornby
was ever a great gentleman, as the following
incident, which occurred during the writer’s Eton
days, will show. Two of the sons of a celebrated
potentate were then at the school, and Queen
Victoria took the warmest interest in them; the
eldest, in particular, was a great favourite of hers.
One day, owing to some untruthfulness in connection
with work, this young Prince was complained
of, and though he might have got off by
claiming “first fault” owing to forgetfulness, was
soundly swished. At the same time he received
a severe, though kindly lecture, in which the
“Head” pointed out how such behaviour would
pain his parents and the Queen, were it ever to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
reach her ears. Curiously enough, that very
evening Dr. Hornby happened to be dining at
Windsor, and as usual his Royal hostess did not
fail to make particular inquiry as to how her
protégé was getting on. What was the surprise of
the young Prince during the following morning to
find himself once again summoned to the “library,”
and as he wended his way to the grim scene of correction,
he wondered what he could have done to
be whipped again so soon. All unpleasant anticipations
were, however, quickly dispelled. In those
gently modulated tones which so many old Etonians
will remember, Dr. Hornby described how, on the
previous evening, a certain great lady had asked
after her favourite Eton boy, and desired to be
informed as to how he had been getting on in
the school. “I told you yesterday,” Dr. Hornby
went on to say, “that one lie always leads to
another, and I am sorry to say in the present
instance this adage has not failed to hold good,
for,” added he, “I am ashamed to say that, instead
of telling Her Majesty of the disgraceful behaviour
for which but a few hours before I had been obliged
to punish you, I said that you were getting on
very well. Under these circumstances I feel sure
that you will do all you can to give no further
trouble, and so, by causing my words to come true,
make amends for the falsehoods which we have
both of us uttered.” The kindly admonition made
a considerable impression upon the culprit’s mind.
Nevertheless, he could not help being amused when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the next Sunday, in Chapel, he heard the Doctor
take as his text, “All men are liars.”</p>

<p>In appearance Dr. Hornby was the absolutely
perfect type of an Eton Headmaster. Immaculately
dressed, and of fine presence, he possessed
a natural dignity which even impressed boys totally
lacking in reverence for all other institutions of the
school. His voice, low and not unpleasant even
when delivering a stem admonition, was essentially
the voice of an English gentleman of the fine old
school. It was a real pleasure to hear him call
“Absence,” owing to the dignity which he imparted
to this tedious duty. Curiously enough, this Headmaster,
who in his latter years, at least, might have
been called the incarnation of the best kind of
Eton Conservatism, had on his appointment been
regarded as a Radical. The first Oppidan, I believe,
ever chosen Headmaster, he had succeeded Dr.
Balston in 1868, when the latter had relinquished
the post from disapproval of the various innovations
and changes which resulted from the recommendations
of the Public School Commission, the
labours of which extended over seven years.</p>

<p>The growing worship of athleticism was in some
measure responsible for the appointment of the
new Headmaster, though Dr. Hornby, besides
having been in the eleven, was also a fine scholar.
When he first came to Eton the school, used to
the patriarchal sway of his predecessor, who had
strictly followed the traditions of the past, were
rather inclined to regard him as a dangerous reformer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
but before long it was realised that such
Radical proclivities as the new Headmaster possessed
were not very likely seriously to impair the
traditional round of Eton life, and the school
gradually subsided into a tranquil consciousness
that nothing outrageous would be perpetrated
under the new “Head,” who long before his retirement
grew to be far more Conservative than
some of his subordinates; indeed, during his tenure
of the Headmastership, which lasted sixteen years,
four Assistant Masters are said to have left Eton
owing to Dr. Hornby disapproving of some of
their ideas. One of these exiles was young Mr.
Joynes, whose socialistic tendencies obviously unfitted
him for the post of an Eton master; another,
Mr. Oscar Browning, whose clever and genial
personality is so well known to numbers of old
Etonians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. BALSTON</div>

<p>Dr. Balston remained at Eton as Vice-Provost,
and I remember that we regarded him with a good
deal of sympathy as having preferred to resign
rather than to yield to meddling on the part
of the governing body, then still looked upon as
rather a new-fangled affair. During his short
term of office he had refused to sanction any
alterations at all. Possessed of an unlimited
respect for old traditions and ways, his conception
of a Headmaster was that he should exercise a sort
of dignified and patriarchal sway, whilst carrying
out a solemn trust to maintain things as they had
always been. Whilst Head he had borne himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
with unbending dignity, being almost never
seen out of academic dress, in which, it was said,
he even went to bed. The same story, I believe,
had been current in the days when Dr. Goodford,
familiarly known as “Old Goody,” ruled the school.
Some indeed declared that a gown and cassock
were all he wore. As Provost, however, the latter
was seen about Eton in ordinary costume and
invariably carrying an umbrella. A quaint, queer
figure this survivor of a past era looked with his
hat at the back of his head and hands covered with
unbuttoned black gloves much too big for him.</p>

<p>At that time the old Fellows who were still
alive used to preach the most lengthy and incomprehensible
sermons in Chapel, but in that line Dr.
Goodford easily held his own against all. Owing
to a peculiar intonation, his mouth always seemed
to be full of pebbles, and it was practically impossible
to make out one sentence of the vast
number which trickled from his lips. Nevertheless
we rather liked the good old man, whose curious
sing-song induced sleep rather than irritation. Dr.
Goodford’s entry into Chapel with the aged verger,
who on account of the silver wand he bore was
called the “Holy Poker,” was a thing which many
Etonians will recall to mind.</p>

<p>Amongst the Assistant Masters of some thirty
years ago, about the most conspicuous figure,
owing to a long flowing beard, was the Rev.
C. C. James, for some reason or other known
as “Stiggins.” He enjoyed no great measure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
popularity out of his house, where, it should be
added, he fed his boys better than almost any other
tutor or dame. At one period of his career he had
narrowly escaped being thrown over Barnes Pool
Bridge by a riotous party of boys, and though no
one seemed to know the exact reason of this, with
later generations it undoubtedly led to his being
regarded with a certain rather unjust suspicion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“BADGER HALE”</div>

<p>A far more sympathetic figure was the Rev. E.
Hale, known to the boys as “Badger Hale,” probably
on account of his hair bearing some remote
resemblance to the coat of that animal. Besides
being a cleric, Mr. Hale was an officer of the Eton
Volunteers. He was of great girth, and when in
uniform presented a really stupendous appearance,
in which the boys took great delight. At that time
the Volunteers were perhaps not taken so seriously
as is the present Officers’ Training Corps, with its
more workman-like appearance and ways. Though
there were occasional field-days, the principal
evolution of the 2nd Bucks was to march, headed
by its band, to the playing-fields. Founded in
1860, by the late ’seventies it had abandoned a good
deal of its splendours, blue worsted cord having
taken the place of the original silver lace, whilst the
colours presented by Mrs. Goodford had ceased to
be carried, the Eton Volunteers being at that time
a rifle corps. Now, however, that it has become
the Officers’ Training Corps, they have once more
been taken into use. The silver bugle given by
Lady Carrington is presumably still carried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. WARRE</div>

<p>The chief support of the Corps has always been
its present Honorary Colonel, the Rev. E. Warre,
now Provost of Eton, who for many years took
a most active part in striving to maintain its well-being
and efficiency. Few have done so much for
Eton as he; his whole life, indeed, has been devoted
to furthering the best interests of the school. As
an Assistant Master he was the avowed champion
of strenuousness and efficiency, whilst opposed to
old ways and traditions tending towards a slack
state of affairs. A strong and dominating personality,
he was intensely popular with the boys
in his own house, but a good part of the school
regarded him with a certain amount of suspicion
as entertaining revolutionary ideas, which it was
said were only kept in check by the firmness of
Dr. Hornby, who in the last days of his Headmastership
was looked upon as the staunch defender
and champion of old Eton ways. In the minds
of ultra-conservative Etonians Dr. Hornby stood
for Conservatism, as Dr. Warre did for change.
Such an estimate was not altogether without
foundation, for after Dr. Warre had succeeded to
the supreme control of the school, a number of
alterations, some of them, no doubt, quite necessary,
were made. The general feeling amongst Eton
boys at that time was Tory in the extreme, and
though we knew scarcely anything about him
except that he had flogged a good deal, I am sure
that a great many of us would have been delighted
to hear that Dr. Keate, having returned to life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
had been entrusted with the task of reorganising
the school with a view to getting it back into the
condition of the good old days.</p>

<p>On the whole the reforms made by Dr. Warre
during his Headmastership seem to have produced
satisfactory results. Most of them dealt with
alterations in the scholastic curriculum of the school,
all the old customs open to criticism, such as
“Oppidan Dinner,” having long disappeared.
Without doubt, under his rule the boys were made
to work harder than before, whilst its tone gained
in manliness and vigour. At the same time the
traditional spirit of Eton remained unimpaired, and
before his retirement Dr. Warre, like his predecessors,
had come to be considered a bulwark
of Eton Conservatism.</p>

<p>The Headmastership of the school would appear
to have a sobering tendency upon even the most
advanced reformer, who at the end of his term of
office has generally lost his enthusiasm for innovation
and change. The present Headmaster is a
case in point. When he came to Eton a few
years ago many were full of gloomy forebodings
as to the reforms he was about to make. Mr.
Lyttelton was known to hold a number of advanced
views&mdash;rumour indeed declared that he would try
and force vegetarianism upon the boys and
would make them wear Jaeger underclothing, for
which material he was declared to have a marked
partiality. On assuming office, however, he somewhat
allayed these fears by giving an address in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
which he announced that he was not going to
stop tap, interfere with clothing, or abolish the
beagles, to which he had been declared hostile.
As a matter of fact, nothing could have been more
loyal than his behaviour in this latter respect, for,
far from discouraging the Eton Hunt, he has
defended it against the ridiculous attacks of
various faddists and cranks. It is, however, to
be regretted that an agitator was two years ago
allowed to address the school on the subject of
unemployment from the Chapel steps in the
school-yard. The vast majority of the parents of
Eton boys do not wish their sons to be taught
Socialism, and the school-yard, so closely connected
with the old traditions of Eton, is the very last
place where any theories of this kind should be
permitted to be aired. As a matter of fact, the
address, which under no circumstances could have
done good, merely provoked giggling. Nevertheless,
it must be admitted that in permitting such an
innovation the Headmaster was merely animated
by that new spirit of philanthropy and altruism
which seems to have found a more useful form
of expression in the Eton Mission, now, according
to all accounts, doing excellent work in Hackney
Wick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INCREASE OF INTERFERENCE</div>

<p>All things considered, Mr. Lyttelton has been
a more successful Headmaster than many old
Etonians expected, and has not made any violent
effort to interfere with the traditions of the school.
Life at Eton, however, without doubt is now more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
strenuous than of yore. Leave has been greatly
curtailed, having to be taken at an appointed time.
Besides this, of late a tendency seems to have
arisen to exercise more control over the boys in
minor matters, as to which in former days the
authorities never thought of interfering. From
time immemorial it has been the privilege of members
of “Pop” to sit on the low wall by the trees,
planted in 1753, especially on Sunday; a recent
regulation forbids any boy, whether belonging to
“Pop” or not, from sitting on the wall on Sunday.
The reason for such a vexatious interference with
an old Eton custom is difficult to divine. A more
reasonable exercise of influence by the Headmaster
has been his attempt to get the boys when in
Chapel to abstain from keeping their hands in
their pockets when standing up during the service.
Such a practice is not forbidden, but an address
on the subject by Mr. Lyttelton is said to have
produced a great effect.</p>

<p>On the whole the masters of to-day would
appear to possess more influence with the boys
than was the case in the past. Now, as then, the
most popular are those who are gentlemen&mdash;that
is, using the word in its best and proper sense.
At the present time, owing to the increased
worship of athletics, proficiency at games is a
powerful factor in a master’s popularity, and
genial eccentricity is also apt to cause him to be
liked; but fads, on the other hand, are not attractive
to boys, which makes it all the more remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
that the present Headmaster&mdash;a professed vegetarian&mdash;should
have attained a fair measure of
success in presiding over the school. No doubt
his fine record as an athlete has had a good deal
to do with this.</p>

<p>In the ’seventies of the last century the attitude
of Eton boys towards the “Beaks” (they are, I
understand, called Ushers now), whilst not actively
hostile, was for the most part one of tolerant
indifference. A few of the masters, however, were
on fairly intimate terms with certain of the Upper
boys, but the majority of the school knew and
cared little about those responsible for its education.
Respect for constituted authority has never
been a salient characteristic of Eton boys, and
amongst the junior members of the school at least
“drawing the beaks” was then considered quite
a legitimate form of amusement. A previous
generation, according to all accounts, found a never-failing
source of delight in lawless doings of this
sort, whilst even Sixth Form occasionally took
advantage of the good-nature of Dr. Hawtrey,
the most urbane Headmaster, it is said, who ever
wielded a birch.</p>

<p>Like his subordinates, he seems to have
been not infrequently exposed to attempts at
“drawing” by his division. These, however, he
generally treated with good-humoured contempt.
During one eleven-o’clock school they once all
became suddenly absorbed in the contemplation
of the rose from which was suspended one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
the chandeliers of Upper School, and, nudging
one another, indulged in mysterious whispers,
which eventually caused Hawtrey to look up
and ask, “Why, whatever is the matter?” “First
of April, sir,” was the reply, but the Headmaster
remained unmoved, and merely murmuring, “Silly
boys,” bade one of them proceed with their construing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“SOMEONE MUST BE LAST”</div>

<p>Dr. Hawtrey did not believe in forcing learning
upon boys, and was never unduly severe with
laggards. “Somebody must be last,” was a
favourite consolatory remark of his when any
derisive titter at the last name in an examination
met his ears. During his tenure of the Headmastership
there was much ease and freedom, for
it was not in his nature to be a martinet.</p>

<p>Full of good intentions and over-politeness to
the boys, it was no wonder that this pedagogue, a
veritable prince amongst schoolmasters, was very
popular in the school. Whatever a boy said he
professed, if possible, to believe, and although his
confidence was often misplaced, this course had
a salutary effect in fostering and cultivating
a gentlemanly spirit. At the same time his very
figure was a caution to evildoers, for he had a
droop in his right shoulder which was supposed
to have come from a frequent and vigorous use
of the birch. Among the Lower boys he was
generally called “Plug,” from some peculiarity in
his countenance, but the swells, by way of refinement,
reversed the name and used “Gulp” instead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
The same kind of satirical humour led to their
ungallantly christening his two old sisters
“Elephantina” and “Rhinocerina.” These ladies
had a sedan-chair in which they went to parties&mdash;one
of the last sedan-chairs probably used. Dr.
Hawtrey had a great liking for velvet collars, fine
clothes, perfumes, and gold chains; one of the
school beliefs was that “Hawtrey stood up in
£700,” the stiff figure at which his boys assessed
his studs, sleeve-links, watch and chains, gold
pencil and rings.</p>

<p>Boys are wonderfully astute judges of whether
a master will stand nonsense or not, and having
discovered that a man cannot keep order, are apt
to bring the art of ingenious torment to a high
pitch of perfection. Old Etonians will recall the
self-control and good-temper shown by certain
masters who had not the knack of making their
authority felt. Their divisions indulged in every
kind of disorder, such as breaking out into applause
at some casual comment, and at a prearranged
moment commencing to stamp and sometimes
even to sing. The keyholes of their class-rooms
were filled with small pebbles or india-rubber,
whilst various substances were put amongst the
papers upon their desk. The writer well remembers
the astonished look on the face of a certain master
when, crawling laboriously towards him upon his
desk, there appeared a poor ink-soaked tortoise,
which, to the intense delight of the division, had at
last accomplished the feat of climbing out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
ink-pot, where it had surreptitiously been deposited
just as school commenced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“NASCITUR NON FIT”</div>

<p>Another master, who was very short sighted, was
always having jokes played upon him just under
his nose. On one occasion it was declared he had
continued to dip his pen in the open mouth of a
particularly torpid toad, substituted for his inkpot,
till the reptile, irritated and aroused, jumped right
in the middle of his face. Yet other masters,
without being particularly severe, kept order
without any difficulty at all, the boys instinctively
realising that they would stand no nonsense. Of
the perfect schoolmaster, indeed, as of the perfect
poet, it may be said, “Nascitur non fit.”</p>

<p>To those men who by nature and disposition
were unable to make their authority felt, school
hours must have often been a time of veritable
torment. Generally well-meaning men of
gentle nature, when they did punish they almost
invariably punished wrong or in an ineffectual
manner, their usual practice being either to set
some tremendous “poena,” which they afterwards
revoked, or settle upon the wrong boy, to whom
in the end they were obliged to accord something
very like an apology. In a few rare instances
the perfectly legitimate loss of temper by a master
led to very grave consequences. Goaded to fury
by a long course of deliberate insubordination,
some tortured tutor would at last turn upon a
pupil and box his ears. Physical chastisement by
a master in any form whatever was then strictly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
forbidden, the infliction of corporal punishment
being reserved for the Head and Lower Masters
alone. The boys were perfectly aware of this,
and instances occurred of grave consequences
attending a well-deserved blow. One master, I
believe, was more or less compelled to leave the
school because he had hit a particularly impertinent
boy with a book, and several instances of masters
receiving reprimands occurred from time to time.
By the irony of fate, the most unsuccessful
masters were sometimes the cleverest men,
who, however, had begun badly and obtained a
reputation which caused them to be tortured by
successive generations of boys. Of one of these
unfortunate pedagogues it was said that during
school hours the first rank of his division talked,
the second whistled, and the third sang.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN UNFORTUNATE MASTER</div>

<p>One of the most ludicrous jokes ever perpetrated
upon any Eton master was played some ten years
ago. At that time several new masters, not all
of whom were Etonians, had been appointed, more
or less, I believe, upon probation. One of these,
who taught modern languages, though a clever
man, was of too confiding and gentle a disposition
to cope with the boys, and during school hours a
scene of great disorder became the almost invariable
rule. Paper darts flew all over the class-room,
and every kind of queer noise was heard, though
the poor man was always unable to bring the
offenders to book. Finally, on the 5th of November
a regular pandemonium prevailed, fireworks being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
exploded in all directions, even under his very
nose, with the result that he was driven into a
state of rage merging upon despair and determined
to adopt stringent measures. On the next
occasion, however, when the same set of boys came
to take their lesson in the language of Molière,
what was his surprise to observe that, contrary to
all his former Eton experiences, the greatest decorum
prevailed, his remarks and comments being
listened to in respectful silence, whilst occasionally
subdued murmurs of admiration greeted the expounding
of some difficult sentence. At the end
of that school it had been his intention to address
a few words to the boys referring to the scandalous
scene of the previous week, but in face of their
changed attitude he felt that it would be churlish
to show any undue severity, and merely spoke in
a tone of surprised regret, adding that he was much
pleased to observe such improved behaviour. Upon
this a boy, who on previous occasions had been one
of the worst offenders, stepping forward, enquired,
“Sir, may I say a few words?” Permission
being accorded, the youth made a stately little
speech, in which he said that any outbursts of
indiscipline were deeply deplored by the whole
division, for whom he had been deputed to speak.
“They were merely,” added he, “playful ebullitions&mdash;proofs,
he might add, of the great popularity
of a master whom they all respected and
loved. The fact was, his friends had been carried
away by enthusiasm, which in future would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
kept within due bounds, and now he hoped the
whole incident might be forgiven and forgotten.
Meanwhile he had been requested to crave a
favour, the granting of which he felt sure no one
acquainted with Eton tradition would care to
refuse. It was,” he continued, “an ancient custom
of the school, when a master attained to an unusual
degree of popularity, for his division to be allowed
the honour of hoisting him, and that honour he
and his friends now sought from their beloved
pedagogue.” The master, though rather surprised,
felt very much flattered and pleased at having, as
he said in a neat little speech of reply, so quickly
gained the confidence and love of his young friends,
and at the end of school was carried round the new
schools, finally being deposited upon the cannon
which all Etonians know so well. As his delighted
boys went off to their houses they gave him a final
cheer, which filled him with joy. On his way
home he met one of the older masters and told
him of the demonstration, adding, “Oh, I do so
adore your quaint customs!” The astounded old
Etonian held his peace, but at the end of that half
the newcomer had to betake himself elsewhere,
it being clear that the Eton boys were too much
for him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ESCAPADES</div>

<p>The old lawless spirit which had prompted so
many poaching expeditions and illicit rambles in
the eighteenth century still lingered in the writer’s
day, when six or seven boys established a regular
club, where they could smoke and play nap, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
room over a Windsor toy-shop. One of the chief
organisers&mdash;now a Peer who has filled several
important public appointments&mdash;always took care
to provide a rope-ladder by which the party might
escape in the event of a raid. Some of the
Windsor billiard-rooms were also occasionally
frequented by a few older boys, some of whom
had a regular arrangement which ensured them the
exclusive use of the table on certain days of the
week. As far as the present writer’s experience
went, no serious harm resulted from these sternly
prohibited escapades. Nevertheless, afternoons
passed in the consumption of much tobacco and
some alcohol did no good to health. The authorities,
whenever any rumour of such breaches of the
school discipline reached their ears, did everything
in their power to set matters right. The wonder
was, considering how alert were some of the
masters, that more of the culprits were not caught.
The writer remembers three&mdash;one of whom was
his friend Mr. Douglas Ainslie, now a well-known
poet and critic&mdash;who had a very narrow escape
indeed. On such afternoons as they indulged
in surreptitious visits to a certain hostelry, these
boys used to get into their house after Lock-Up
through the room of a small fag, who received
careful instructions to look out for their return
behind the drawn blind of his window, by which
access could be contrived from the street. The
signal agreed upon was a pebble thrown gently
at the glass. For a time this arrangement worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
well enough, but one winter’s evening the party,
on reaching their house, were dismayed at obtaining
no response. One of them&mdash;in after life
a gallant officer of Highlanders who fell fighting
at the head of his men in South Africa&mdash;by
climbing up and breaking a pane of glass, managed
to effect an entrance; his companions followed,
and what was their surprise on relighting the
light, which had fallen over in the scuffle, to
find, cowering in the corner of the room, a
beautiful little girl, who was fairly frightened
to death! When at last reassured, this child
explained that she was the sister of the owner of
the room, who had gone out to borrow some
tea-things from a friend. Needless to say, under
such circumstances, the Lower boy got no hiding
for his delinquency.</p>

<p>In addition to his traditional duties, a master,
it seems, now has to mark in the boys in his
class-room. Formerly this was done by a praepostor,
one being attached to every division.
His office dated from the foundation of the
school, when he appears to have possessed
considerable authority, being indeed a sort of
monitor. In modern times, however, praepostors
merely had to mark in all the boys in the
division to which they were attached under three
heads, “Leave,” “Staying out,” and “ab horâ” or
“Late.” After every school all the praepostors
assembled in the colonnade and handed in their
bills to the Headmaster. As a rule the office of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
praepostor, undertaken by every boy in turn, was
popular, for such an official escaped most of the
school hours, was never put on to construe, and
passed a good deal of his time chatting to boys
reported sick, whom he had to go and see. Some
boys disliked it, however, and by arrangement
passed the praepostor’s book on. The whole
institution was a curious survival of a past age.
Well does the present writer remember standing
as praepostor by the side of Dr. Hornby calling
Absence in the school-yard and thinking that the
ancient office would not last very much longer.
Within recent years his forebodings have been
justified, for at present but one praepostor (of the
Headmaster’s division) exists, the work of marking
in being undertaken by masters in school and the
boys at the end of the benches in Chapel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROOMS</div>

<p>Thirty or forty years ago life in an Eton house
remained much as it had been in the eighteenth
century, the boys, provided they did their work,
being left pretty much to themselves, though
some housemasters interfered to prevent boisterous
sports, such as football in the passages. The
rooms, though often very small, were, it must be
said, not uncomfortable, and quite a number of
boys prided themselves upon their taste in decoration.
Some even had pianos in their rooms, a
privilege which was highly valued and seldom
abused. The furniture of the rooms generally
varied but little. For the most part it consisted
of a shut-up bed, a “burry” (bureau) washstand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
which also closed up, and sock cupboard. In this
the owner kept his tea-things and such delicacies
as he could afford. A favourite form of decoration
was a mantel-board covered, according to Victorian
taste, with stamped plush and brass-headed nails.
In the summer term there was some competition
in the matter of fire-ornaments and flower-boxes.
The former were generally appalling in their
vulgarity, their main feature being a profusion
of extremely garish ornament, mostly tinsel and
sham gold. Almost every boy had a few pictures,
generally of a sporting kind, even though he himself
had never taken part in sport. The Eton
print shops must have done a fine trade in oleographs
and poorly reproduced representations of
famous runs and steeplechases. Some few brought
comparatively good pictures with them from home.
The writer remembers a set of Eton prints in a
boy’s room which at the present day it would be
extremely difficult to procure at all. The books
were, of course, mostly connected with work, a
crib or two being generally hidden away in case
of a raid. On the whole an Eton boy was
extremely comfortable, for he could have pretty
well anything he or his parents could afford to
pay for, while there was scarcely one who did not
boast an arm-chair.</p>

<p>On the whole, the long-suffering boys’ maids,
as they were called, did their work very well. As
a rule, it should be added, they were middle-aged
women, not remarkable for beauty. One housemaster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
indeed&mdash;Mr. Walter Durnford, formerly
a popular figure at Eton, and now Vice-Provost
of King’s&mdash;according to current report, used, with
perfect justice, to pride himself upon the extreme
ugliness of his maids. Be this as it may, the boys
of his house, which was next to the writer’s, were
often to be seen peering through their windows
in order to catch a glimpse of one of our maids, of
whose good looks we were quite justly proud.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAGGING</div>

<p>Fagging, though probably more arduous than
to-day, entailed little hardships on the smaller boys.
Thirty years ago a fag’s duties consisted in laying
his fagmaster’s breakfast, procuring chops, steaks,
kidneys, or sausages from a sock shop, making
toast, and poaching eggs. He had to attend at
tea-time again, but then as a rule was not called
upon to do anything in particular, his appearance
at that hour being more or less a matter of form.
Besides this, a fag had to carry notes and render
other similar services when required to do so, while
obliged to answer to the call of “Lower boy”
shouted by any one in Upper Division. It should
be added that the qualification as to place in the
school entitling boys to fag has gradually been
heightened. Formerly the whole of the Fifth
Form could fag; but about three decades ago that
privilege was withdrawn from the Lower Division,
and I believe the number of fagmasters has been
further lessened since then. This was not on
account of the privilege of fagging having been
abused, but merely because the number of Upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
boys had grown too large in proportion with those
of the Lower. With the institution of breakfasts
provided by housemasters and eaten by the boys
all together, fagging has shrunk to a mere nothing.
The most irksome part formerly was being obliged
to answer the call of “Lower boy,” when every
one “fagable” was obliged to rush at headlong
speed to the caller, the last to arrive being the
one who had to perform the particular service
required. In College, I believe, “Here” was called
instead of “Lower boy.” Also, at one time, it
would appear that any boy able to call out “Finge”
before the rest could claim exemption from taking
notice of the call. I must, however, add that I
never heard anything about this when I was at
Eton. Another College shout was “Cloister P!”
on hearing which the lowest boy within call had to
fetch a canful of excellent drinking water from the
famous old pump in the Cloisters, at the spout of
which, in a rougher age, many generations of
Collegers had performed their ablutions. Owing
to the dearth of Lower boys in College for a long
time past, it has been the custom that every newcomer,
irrespective of his place in the school, should
fag for a year.</p>

<p>In the distant past cricket fagging existed, and
must have pressed very heavily upon small boys,
who were liable to be waylaid by Fifth Form
boys coming out of school. Cricket fagging then
included bowling, and was an irksome infliction
which was just as well done away with. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
disagreeable form of fagging which has now long
been extinct was crib fagging, which consisted in a
small boy being obliged to read out a crib to an
assemblage of big ones. As a rule, on these occasions
another fag would be posted in the passage
outside in order to give time for the crib to be
secreted should there be any chance of the tutor
making his unwelcome appearance. Towing boats
up to Surly was the most severe form of fagging.
This was abolished by Keate some eighty years ago.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NO BULLYING</div>

<p>It is much to the credit of the Eton system
that amongst the Oppidans (the state of affairs in
old Long Chamber was different) there seems
never to have existed any bullying. During the
investigations of the Commission in 1861 all the
evidence tended to show that small boys underwent
no ill-treatment or persecution whatever. In
the writer’s opinion this in a great measure
accounts for the independent and buoyant spirit
which has ever been a characteristic of Etonians
in after life. Many sensitive boys educated at
schools where bullying has prevailed have felt the
results of it in a tamed and often broken spirit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“ORDERS”</div>

<p>One of the peculiarities of Eton in old days was
that unless a boy supplemented his dietary by the
purchase of provisions from the shops in the town
he would often have to go hungry, and even thirty
years ago in most of the houses the old Eton
traditions as regards feeding were in full force.
All the boys received was a loaf, pat of butter,
and pot of tea for breakfast. Luncheon they all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
had together with their dame in the large dining-room;
this was a fairly substantial meal. Tea
taken in their own rooms exactly resembled breakfast,
besides which there was a very light supper
in the dining-room, at which attendance was
optional. Almost without exception, of course, this
somewhat meagre fare was supplemented by the
boys themselves, who purchased appetising dishes
from the sock shops at a reasonable price. An
Eton custom at that day, which probably still
exists, was for the boys to have what were called
“orders” at one of these shops. This “order”
consisted in an agreement with a shopkeeper to
supply a boy with provisions to a certain amount
every day, the boy’s father or mother having previously
paid a sum in advance. The arrangement
was, of course, intended to prevent the boy from
finding himself bereft of all luxuries after the
pocket-money given him when he left home had
been exhausted; but, as a matter of fact, in the case
of the more extravagant boys it almost invariably
missed its mark, for, getting round the shopkeeper,
they would persuade him to allow the anticipation
of their “order,” with the result that whilst during
the first fortnight of the half they revelled in every
sort of delicacy, their breakfasts and teas during
the remainder of the school time were unenlivened
by any toothsome dishes. The most popular sock
shops were then Harry Webber’s (now Rowland’s)
and “little Brown’s,” the door of which the
writer, on a recent visit to Eton, found shut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>The system of “orders” extended to other
things besides sock shops, a dame or housemaster
having the power of giving them for clothes or any
other necessary. A boy applying for one of these
signed permits was supposed to be able to prove
that he was really in want of the article he wished
to procure, and, the order being handed to him, was
recognised by a tradesman as a valid voucher that
the sum for which it stood would be included in
the boy’s bill at the end of the half. On the whole
this arrangement worked well, but occasionally
unscrupulous boys, by arrangement with some not
over particular tradesman, would obtain some other
article which was really anything but a necessary.</p>

<p>Dames were sometimes easy about granting
“orders,” and not a few boys prided themselves
upon their adroitness in obtaining anything they
liked, and some of them managed to run up
comparatively large accounts with their housemaster’s
or dame’s permission. An even more
extravagant and reckless kind of boy would contrive
to persuade some tradesman (generally a
London one who knew something about the
circumstances of his parents) to allow him to run
up bills without any “order” at all, the understanding
being that these should be paid when the boy
had left school or came of age. One such case the
writer well remembers, the perpetrator being a
very dissipated youth celebrated throughout the
school for always being in trouble with the authorities.
This boy was a great dandy as regards dress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
and it was currently reported that he never wore
the same pair of trousers twice. This, of course,
was an exaggeration, but he certainly had a
wonderful stock of clothes. On leaving Eton he
had accumulated debts to a considerable figure, and
his after career was anything but a success, for after
attempting various forms of occupation, including
amateur newspaper reporting, he was last heard
of keeping a little store in South Africa. An
account of the curious professions adopted by
Eton boys would fill a volume. On the whole,
however, the majority do well, as, after all, is
only to be expected, considering that in the first
instance their parents must have been possessed of
considerable funds in order to send them to Eton
at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IMPISH MISCHIEF</div>

<p>Some tutors, unable to keep order in their
houses, were the victims of all sorts of unpleasant
jokes. One of the most mischievous and dangerous
of these was to stretch a string across a passage and
then set to work to create such a noise as would be
sure to attract the tutor’s attention, with the result
that when he arrived upon the scene he would be
tripped up. Another diversion of a somewhat
similar sort was to pile a number of iron coal-scuttles
just at the top of a flight of stairs, and,
after creating a great din, kick them down upon
the ascending tutor, who would seldom be able to
discover the organiser of the outrage. A more
amusing trick was the following. A small Lower
boy, having, with his own consent, been tied up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
one of the huge dirty linen bags, was placed in the
middle of a passage and told to keep perfectly
motionless till he felt a slight kick, when he was to
rise at his assailant and hold on to his legs, calling
out the name of some big boy well known to all.
This being done, all the occupants of the passage
would set to work to make sufficient noise to produce
their tutor’s appearance, upon which complete
silence would prevail. Nine times out of ten the
tutor, walking down the passage to ascertain the
reason of the disturbance, seeing the dirty linen
bag, would try and kick it on one side, with the
result that, rising at him, it would clutch him by
the leg and cause him to execute a multitude of
undignified gyrations, to the delight of boys peeping
through doors just ajar. When, finally, the
small boy had been extricated from the bag, it was
very difficult to punish him, for he would invariably
plead that he had been tied up against his will, and
in pinching his assailant’s legs had been merely
acting in self-defence against some one whom he had
good reason to suspect was a persecuting schoolfellow.</p>

<p>Throwing bits of coal out of the window at
passers-by or shooting with a catapult used to be
favourite pastimes with boys of a past age. Fierce
battles were sometimes waged in the winter evenings
between the boys in adjacent houses, when they
would bombard each other with pea-shooters or
squirts charged with ink or water. Occasionally
this warfare involved onlookers in the street below.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
The writer remembers a great disturbance caused
by an angry policeman whose helmet and uniform
had been liberally bespattered with ink.</p>

<p>Some of the houses contained broad and lengthy
passages, on each side of which were ranged boys’
rooms, a favourite amusement for the occupants of
which was standing by the open doors and awaiting
the cry of “Slough; change here for Staines,
Windsor, Datchet,” when every boy would slam
his door in turn down the passage with a view to
produce the effect of a train about to start.
Immediately after the completion of this manœuvre
the boys would at once fly to their “burries”
(bureaus), at which they would be found hard at
work when the infuriated tutor or housemaster
arrived to discover the cause of the disturbance.
In some cases the unfortunate man would ignore
the first performance of this ingenious form of
torture, but a second and louder slamming seldom
failed to bring him in hot haste from his private
quarters. To punish for this kind of thing was
exceedingly difficult, for the boys were, of course,
at liberty to shut their doors, and collusion was not
easy to prove.</p>

<p>A number of boys spent their time experimenting
with electricity and chemicals, and the writer
well remembers a friend having his face severely
injured by the explosion of some dangerous
compound mixed together in a flower-box. On
another occasion the same boy (now a well-known
sporting peer) occasioned a serious panic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Having inserted some detonating composition
amongst the bricks of the railway arches over
which trains run into Windsor, he contrived to
make it explode just before the Royal train bearing
Queen Victoria passed. It was a time when
Ireland was in a very disturbed state, and there
was much dread of some outrage. Consequently
the Windsor and Eton police were convinced that
the explosion had a political origin, and every
effort was made by means of detectives to find the
perpetrator. It was, however, never discovered
that he was an Eton boy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOAXING THE PRESS</div>

<p>About thirty years ago, Eton boys were seized
with a craze for hoaxing the London Press, and
some extraordinary letters appeared in various
papers. The most extraordinary of all was one
bearing the signature of an Eton master which
described the writer’s remarkable experiences in
the country, where he had witnessed a conflict
between a cow and a partridge, in which the cow,
after a prolonged chase, had eventually captured
and devoured the bird. The master eventually
wrote an indignant denial, but he was never able
to discover who had taken his name in vain.</p>

<p>The greatest practical joke ever played at Eton
was the colossal hoax perpetrated in the early
eighties of the last century upon the somewhat
ingenuous editor of a newly-started London magazine,
who had been struck with the idea of increasing
its attractions by publishing authentic news of
public-school life. Not unnaturally he began with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Eton, and, setting to work to secure contributors
at that school, obtained some really astounding
information, which afterwards went to the making
of an extremely scarce little book called <cite>Eton
as She is not</cite>. More recently an amusing account
of the whole affair appeared in the <cite>Cornhill
Magazine</cite> at the end of an excellent article on
“College at Eton.” At first the editor’s correspondents
merely furnished him with accounts of
local events, all of them pure invention; but,
emboldened by success, they soon went on to
describe some interesting old customs. The first
was chronicled thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A curious custom takes place here on certain days in
College Dining Hall, called “Passing the Green Stuff.” The
second fellow at the big fellows’ table suddenly says, “Pass
me that Green Stuff,” referring to a dish of mint placed on
the table; then the fellow opposite him stands up, and says
“Surgite” (arise), on which all the other fellows get up from
their places and run the fellow who “broached” (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> asked
for) the green stuff round the School Paddocks, shouting out
such military commands as “Quick march! Right turn!”
etc. They then return to dinner, when a “grace-cup” is
partaken by all except him who “broached” the green stuff.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">“SLUNCHING” THE PADDOCKS</div>

<p>In the next number readers were informed that
at Eton Prisoner’s Base is a great success, and the
Paddock is almost always deserted for the Cloisters.
The following then appeared:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Another curious custom at Eton is “Slunching the
Paddocks.” On a certain day all the Collegians and
Oppidans are provided with a coarse sort of pudding, which
is put to the following use. After dinner is over they all go
to Weston’s and School Paddocks and throw their pudding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
all over them. This is “Slunching the Paddocks,” the
pudding being called “Slunch.” It is supposed to be derived
from the fact that when Queen Elizabeth visited Eton
College “she lunched” (s’lunched) in College Hall, and the
students sprinkled the paddocks with dry rice in her honour.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the number published on March 5, 1884, a
purely imaginary list of the officials of the various
school departments was given. There were the
Captains of the “Broach” and the “Slunch,” the
two College boats; the Captain of Cricket Tassels,
R. J. Lucas;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Captain of Fives Tassels, Havager
Boroughdale; Captain of the Musical Department,
R. A. S. Berry-Young; Captain of the Curling
Club, T. T. Vator; Captain of the Spelican Team,
Tute Goodhart; Captain of Ushers, J. Goodwin;
Steward of the Paddocks, H. Beecham Wolley;
Choragus, C. Wofflington. This was followed in
the next number by the news that the Spelican
team had played their first match of the season
on March 11 against the Dorney Dubes. The
Collegian Brigade, an admirable corps, which
marched out as far as Brocas Hedges, was later on
described as having met with a catastrophe, for “a
bull loose in Weston’s Paddock, which they passed
through on the way, attacked the line, and a boy
named Swage was knocked over and slightly
bruised.”</p>

<p>This went on for six months, when the Editor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
wrote and expressed a desire to come down to Eton
and see the place for himself. He was duly shown
a hockey match between B. Wolley’s “Field
Mice” and Flenderbatch’s “Jolly Boys,” the match
being played with tassels on the caps and all, which
so impressed him that he returned to London and
wrote an account of what he had seen, giving at
the same time a new and original version of the
School Song, addressed to “Pulcra Etona” and
praying among other things that:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentbase">Slunna fluat,
</div><div class="indentbase">Semper ruat
</div><div class="indent15">Capti fundamentum.
</div></div></div></div>

<p>“Slunna” is slunch, “capti fundamentum” is
sound Latin for prisoner’s base. In high good
temper he added that “our Eton correspondence is
supplied by a gentleman who is a universal favourite
in College, and the Editor is pleased to state that
he has received letters from Etonians all over the
world, signifying their approval of his reports.”
He was disillusioned soon after, and no more space
was devoted to Eton and the strange doings of its
students.</p>

<p>Though at that time something of the old-world
spirit still lingered, there survived few of the quaint
“characters” who had once been fairly numerous at
Eton. The ever-gentle, suave, and urbane Giles of
Williams’ (afterwards Ingalton Drake’s, and now
Spottiswoode’s) will, however, be remembered by
many. How this good-natured man managed to
book the orders at the beginning of a school-time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
and keep his temper is a mystery which will never
be solved. He had, I remember, a red-headed
assistant, who, though a shade more inclined to
frivolity than Giles (who was scholastic gravity
itself), seemed to have been born to serve out broad
rule and derivation paper without being ever in the
least perturbed by the chatter of crowds of Lower
boys.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOLOMON</div>

<p>Another grave-looking character of this period
was Solomon, who all day long stood in a minute
room at the back of Brown’s, the hosier, ironing
hats. Solomon’s appearance and demeanour did
not accord ill with his appellation. He was a
white-headed old man who always wore a paper
cap somewhat resembling the traditional head-dress
of a French cook. Standing in his shirt-sleeves
gently working his iron over the nap of ill-used
“toppers,” his favourite topic was the Turf, of which
surely no more ardent votary ever lived. All day
long he would discuss with the various boys who
streamed into his little workroom the chances
of the horses entered for the next classic race.
Solomon was essentially an old-fashioned turfite
in his ideas, and knew nothing of starting-price
jobs or other new-fangled manœuvres. He was,
however, acquainted with the form of all the more
prominent race-horses, and in his conversation laid
gentle stress upon the value of a judgment which
no one wished to dispute. In spite of the old
man’s ardent affection for racing, I cannot help
thinking that during his long life he had seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
seen any races run. On this subject, however, it
was best to hold one’s peace. Though Solomon’s
sanctum was the scene of such eternal confabulations
as to the great question of first, second, and
third, I cannot remember that much betting arose
from it. As far as my memory serves me, the
majority of Solomon’s visitors remained purely
academic in their patronage of racing. Perhaps
this was owing to the fact that the Lower boys,
of whom his ever-changing audience was for the
most part composed, had very little money, and
preferred to spend what they had in substantial
dainties rather than risk it in speculations of a
visionary kind. I do not recollect Solomon doing
any serious betting for boys, but have a vague idea
he occasionally put shillings on. I was therefore
surprised when told some years ago that the old
man had been driven out of his place owing to the
action of the College authorities, who objected to
him as demoralising the boys by assisting them to
bet. I can only hope that this report was untrue,
for in my day, at least, his influence was quite
harmless.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BETTING</div>

<p>In the sixties, I believe, there used to be a
school Derby lottery every year, the winner of
which generally got about £25. The arrangements
for this seem to have been placed in the
hands of a well-known character about the “wall”
named “Snip,” but he had died or disappeared
long before my day, and the only lottery I remember
was a tiny private affair, the tickets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
which cost sixpence or a shilling. In connection
with this subject it is said that of late
years betting amongst the boys has become a
serious evil. If this is the case, the school must
have undergone a considerable change in its
ideas within the last quarter of a century. In
the late seventies and early eighties there was
practically no betting at all amongst the boys,
chiefly for the reason just given, but also because
there existed a widespread idea that any attempt
at speculation would eventually lead to loss of
money. A good many boys, no doubt, who had a
love for the Turf looked forward to gratifying
a taste for speculation in time to come, whilst
others told extravagant tales of Turf triumphs
during the holidays, but few took racing seriously,
their interest being limited to flocking to the
post-office to hear the first news as to the winner
of any great race. A salient proof that at that
date no real betting existed was the sensation
caused amongst us by the rumour, based on truth,
that a new boy (the son of the Maharajah Duleep
Singh, whose arrival at Eton created some sensation),
on being spoken to by a member of the eight
in the school-yard, had offered to bet him a fiver
against a certain horse, which wager had been
accepted. This was the largest wager we ever
heard of as being made at Eton, and it was
looked upon as extraordinary.</p>

<p>On the other side of the High Street, opposite
to the establishment where Solomon ironed hats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
and gave forth his wisdom, a younger rival also
doctored battered “toppers.” As far as I can
remember, he was a far rougher individual than
the racing sage, and possessed a tendency towards
familiarity which was not universally popular.
He and Solomon both resembled each other in
one respect, which was their taste for plastering
every available inch of their walls with cuts
and paragraphs from cheap papers of a comic
order.</p>

<p>A curious character amongst the sock shopkeepers
of that period was an old Italian confectioner,
who owned rather a spacious shop with
very little in it up the High Street, on the right-hand
side going from Eton towards Windsor
Bridge. This worthy, who was always attired
in a cook’s dress&mdash;white cap, apron, and all&mdash;made
and sold most excellent ices, which procured
him a fair amount of custom from the Eton boys
in spite of the fact that his shop was considered
rather “scuggish.” According to common report,
the proprietor had once been employed at Windsor
Castle, where his skill as an ice-maker had won the
favour of Queen Victoria, with whom for a time
he had become a particular favourite. One day,
however, the Queen had caught him administering
a thundering thrashing to his wife, in consequence
of which she had very rightly at once turned him
out of his post. This story, though resting upon
no credible evidence, was generally believed by
Lower boys, and some of them made a practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
of infuriating the old man by hurling taunts at
him as they were going out of his shop. “What
a pity, ‘Cally,’ you got kicked out of the Queen’s
kitchen!” they would call out, and the little Italian
never failed to fly into a great rage at their chaff.
Indeed, on more than one occasion he was said to
have pursued boys into the street with a knife in
his hand, but this in all probability was mere
exaggeration. Nevertheless he had a violent
temper, and for this reason was constantly being
drawn by mischievous boys.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A POPULAR INSTITUTION</div>

<p>A more improving occupation than chaffing
tradesmen was reading books and papers at
Ingalton Drake’s, the bookseller, who afterwards
took over Williams’, where all the school books
were sold. This establishment, owing to the good
nature of the proprietor, was constantly thronged
with a crowd of boys, who, seldom making any
purchase, spent a good deal of time turning over
the leaves of new books just fresh from London.
The <cite>Times</cite> could also be read there. As a matter
of fact, the boys were very careful not to hurt or
dirty the books they took up or touched, and I do
not think the owner of the establishment had
reason to regret his kindliness, which was the
means of many Etonians acquiring an insight into
branches of knowledge which the school curriculum
made no attempt to include. Many a pleasant and
not uninstructive half-hour was passed here by
boys to whom cut-and-dried lessons made no
appeal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">HOISTING</div>

<p>The Eton traditions of three decades ago were
not very many in number, most of them being
concerned with minor points of dress, things which
were to be done and were not to be done, and the
like. Except hoisting, few old usages survived,
though, no doubt, the opinions of many long-past
generations still influenced the boys in their
unwritten code of what was “scuggish” and what
was not. Hoisting, I believe, still survives, though
a very few years ago undue exuberance on the
part of the boys nearly caused its abolition. At
that time (1904-1905) the whole school would
assemble along the wall on the evening of the
School Pulling, which always takes place after
Lord’s, and await the arrival of the members of
“Pop,” who from Tap would walk arm-in-arm
across the whole street to opposite their Club Room
in the building of the old Christopher. They would
then seize the winners of the School Pulling, and,
according to traditional custom, run up and down
along the wall with them, the whole school shouting
at the top of their voices. If the eleven had won
at Lord’s, or the eight at Henley, its members
were also hoisted one by one. In the case of the
School Pulling, the winners, after being hoisted,
were taken to some prominent upper window in
one of the houses which all could see, and water
solemnly poured over their heads, the jugs and
crockery being eventually thrown out into the
street. This latter generally occurred just before
Lock-up, all the boys being still out in the street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
The end was that “Pop” canes were produced,
arms linked, and everybody systematically driven
into his tutor’s house. The ceremony of hoisting
was not very popular with the public, for, in consequence
of the noise, passing carts and carriages
generally went by a good deal quicker than the
drivers wished, and horses became alarmed, whilst
no bicyclist was allowed to remain on his bicycle,
every one who passed being booed or cheered.
Thirty years ago the ceremony proceeded much
in the same way, though there was more consideration
shown to the drivers of horses which looked
likely to become alarmed by noise; also the
crockery-smashing ceremonial did not exist, and
would have been resented had any attempt been
made to institute it.</p>

<p>Like another custom of modern origin, “Lock-up
Parade,” this very undesirable addition to hoisting
has now been forbidden. Lock-up Parade, which
did not exist in the writer’s Eton days, took place
in the Summer Half, just before the hour of Lock-up,
when the boys walked backwards and forwards
within very narrow limits to the strains of musicians
stationed outside “Tap.”</p>

<div id="Fig_328" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Eton College from the River.<br />
<em>From an old coloured print.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Tap is, if possible, more flourishing than ever,
being, as of old, crowded on summer evenings. At
such a time whilst the wet bobs on their way home
from the Brocas fill it to overflowing, a number of
swagger dry bobs also put in an appearance. In
addition to the traditional refreshments procurable
at Tap, chops, steaks, bread and cheese, beer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
cider, coffee, chocolate, cakes, fruit, and other good
things of the same kind may now be got there,
with the result that it is also much frequented
after twelve, though, of course, not by Lower
boys, who are still excluded as of old. A modern
Eton fashion is the giving of a breakfast under a
tent in the garden of Tap during the summer
term. This is a very “swagger” affair, most
of “Pop” putting in an appearance. A few years
ago, when some of the members of the Eton
Society were more than usually vivacious in disposition,
the return from Tap in the evening just
before Lock-up was occasionally very noisy, top-hats
flying about in all directions, and passers-by finding
it difficult to proceed on their way without
being playfully held up. At present, however, the
summer evenings are once again peaceful as of
yore&mdash;a happy state of affairs which should delight
every true lover of Eton, for it is beneath the
rays of a setting sun that the tranquil charm of
the old red-brick walls and weather-beaten
buildings makes itself especially felt. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>SWINBURNE’S LINES<span class="hidev">|</span></span> At this
time of year is it, more than any other, that
the crowning glory of the place&mdash;the playing
fields fringed by the silver winding Thames&mdash;present
such a superb scene of placid beauty,
whilst College close by whispers from its towers
“the last enchantment of the Middle Age.” No
wonder that, in spite of altered ways and habits,
the spirit fostered by such stately surroundings
still remains alive&mdash;</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that these lines, written by
the last great Etonian poet to celebrate the 450th
anniversary of the foundation, will be as applicable
to the school five hundred years hence as they
are to-day. May those yet to come continue
to bear the torch of Eton, handed down from
distant generations, bravely aloft, whilst never
ceasing to keep before their eyes the duty of
delivering it to their successors, its flame bright
and brilliant as of old.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
